        <p><strong>SPACE IS VAST</strong>, dark, and not your friend. Gamma rays and
            neutrino bursts erupt from dying stars to cook you alive,
            black holes tear you apart, and the void itself boils your
            blood and seizes your brain. Try to scream and no one can

        <p>Space isn't as empty as you’d think, either – its frontiers
            are ever expanding. Rival governments wage a cold war
            of aggression while greedy corporations vie for valuable

            with their lives – each new world tamed is either feast or
            famine. And there are things lurking in the shadows of every
            asteroid – things strange and different and deadly.</p>
        <p>Things alien.</p>
        <p>This is the ALIEN roleplaying game – a universe of body
            horror and corporate brinkmanship, where synthetic people
            play god while space truckers and marines serve as hosts
            to newborn ghoulish creatures.</p>
        <p>It’s a harsh and unforgiving universe and you are nothing

            The titular alien – in all its iterations – is the stuff of nightmares.
            From Neomorph to Xenomorph, the mystique
            surrounding these creatures is mesmerizing. The alien
            represents everything we don’t understand about the
            natural world. It evokes a fear of our bodies being violated
            and used. It is a parasitic invader whose only intent is to
            use humanity to breed and incubate its progeny. The alien
            lifecycle is one of death and renewal, but the only part
            people play in that circle is death.</p>
        <p>
            But the ALIEN saga itself is about more than otherworldly
            beasts. It is about humbling humanity for its own
            hubris. It’s about motherhood and family – about loss
            and sacrifice. It wrestles with the questions of artificial
            intelligence and faith. The story of ALIEN is about
            creators and their creations struggling for dominance
            over each other.</p>
        <p>It’s about corporate greed and avarice, and it’s about
            how superior firepower and fancy technology aren’t
            enough to protect you from the horrors of the unknown. It’s
            about pushing the envelope and sticking your nose where
            it doesn’t belong, consequences be damned before they
            damn you.</p>
        <p>
            The ALIEN roleplaying game takes you to the rough
            and tumble colony worlds on the Frontier of known
            space. It’s on the cusp of this unforgiving place that your
            character must face their demons – both of the inner
            and other kind.

        <h1>FRONTIER LIFE</h1>
        <div class="alien-h1-quote">
            "Is this really where you want to spend the rest of your life?"
        </div>
        <div class="alien-h1-quote-author">Tyler and Rain</div>

        <p><strong>THE FRONTIER BEGINS</strong> on the leading edge of the Outer
            Veil, crosses through the Outer Rim of the known territories,
            and stretches on into deep space. Located between the
            core systems and the Outer Rim, the Outer Veil is a vast
            region of space that is abundantly rich in mineral resources.
            The Outer Rim is extensively colonized, and the Colonial
            Navy operates there. Past the Outer Rim is anyone’s guess
            – and that thrill of the unknown is what draws pioneers here.
            Settlers have likened the sometimes lawless Frontier to the
            Old West of the United States.</p>
        <p>
            Here, life is harsh and cheap. On many worlds, atmospheric
            processors have been brought in to convert the
            air into something passably breathable. The majority of
            settlers here are prospectors, entrepreneurs, farmers, and
            homesteaders. Mining worlds refine ores and fuel, while
            agri and aquatic worlds harvest food and algae. Space
            stations such as Anchorpoint serve as neutral staging
            grounds for expeditions into deep space.</p>
        <p>
            Neighboring colonies don’t always get along, and armed
            conflicts over stakes and claims are not uncommon – often
            requiring the Colonial Marines to step in and restore order. The
            boundaries of the Frontier are ever-shifting, and sometimes
            colonies switch hands as border disputes redefine the map</p>

        <h2>Territories Of The Frontier</h2>
        <p>While dominated by the United Americas, the Frontier is
            an area intersected by several nation-states. An uneasy
            alliance exists between them, yet territorial disputes
            are not unheard of. What follows is a listing of the major
            government players vying for resources there.</p>
        <p>

        <p>
        <h3>Three World Empire:</h3> Consisting of the former United
        Kingdom, Japan, and several developing countries,
        the Weyland-Yutani corporation itself is a result of
        the formation of the Three World Empire – created
        when the UK company Weyland Corp merged with the
        Japanese Yutani Corporation. The Three World Empire
        pioneered space exploration, controls many longestablished
        inner colonies, and only maintains a limited
        presence on the Frontier – allowing Weyland-Yutani to
        take the lead there.</p>

                Looks like Reed went below to sleep it off, and now Nat's trashed the galley and locked herself in their
                quarters.

            </div>
        </div>

        <p>
        <h3>The United Americas:</h3> Created in the early 2100s to
        compete with the expanding Three World Empire, the
        United Americas was formed by the merger of North,
        Central, and South America into one nation. The United
        Americas is a major colonizing and starfaring power,
        constantly expanding the Frontier. They operate both the
        Colonial Marines and the Colonial Navy – the most powerful
        peace-keeping forces on the Frontier.</p>

        <p>
        <h3>The Union Of Progressive Peoples:</h3> The UPP is a
        powerful socialist block of systems that control a vast
        but resource-poor sector of space. Formed from a
        coalition of countries that includes Russia and Vietnam,
        the UPP is the only government that is not influenced by
        corporate concerns – a fact that sometimes puts them
        in opposition to Weyland-Yutani. While they are behind
        in the arms race, the UPP still maintains a formidable
        fighting force. A state of cold war has existed between
        the United Americas and the UPP for decades, but with
        recent events on the Frontier, all that seems poised to
        change.</p>

        <p>
        <h3>The Independent Core System Colonies:</h3> The ICSC
        is a loose conglomerate of privately-owned worlds. Each
        colony in the ICSC has its own government – many of
        which are corporate-owned. In addition to its operations
        within the colonies of the United Americas and the Three
        World Empire, Weyland-Yutani is known to maintain private
        interests in the ICSC – where they can conduct business as
        they see fit, far from the prying eyes of government control.</p>

        <h2>Dominion Over The Stars</h2>

        <p>
            While governments control the colonies, they aren’t the
            only ones with influence there.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Corporate Dominance:</h3> Although nation-states
        dominate the stars, it is important to note that the real
        power lies in the corporations that exist across them.
        Companies like Weyland-Yutani, Lasalle Bionational, and
        Seegson are not limited by borders. In fact, they produce
        and control the technologies necessary for the continued
        existence of these star empires. The unwillingness of
        nation-states like the UPP to work with the private sector
        has left them behind in the space race.</p>

        <p>
        <h3>God At The Ass End Of Space:</h3> Life in the colonies is
        rough. After being promised a utopia, settlers instead found
        a frontier existence of drudgery in harsh environments. To
        that end, many have turned to God to get them through
        their daily rigors. While traditional religions are practiced
        throughout the colonies, sects of apocalyptic millenarian
        fundamentalists have arisen, in isolated areas. Recent
        years have seen the rise of fledgling organizations with
        questionable motives, such as the Practitioners of the
        Holy Immolation and the cultish Church of Immaculate
        Incubation.</p>

        <h2>This Is Rumor Control</h2>
        <p>Stories spread faster than light on the Frontier. Some scouts
            tell tales of priceless artifacts found in ancient ruins on distant
            moons – ruins that predate humanity by millennia. Others talk
            of derelict spacecraft – and a race of giants that once stalked
            the stars in them. Still others whisper about hostile lifeforms
            that overrun entire worlds – terrifying parasitic creatures that
            are beyond our comprehension and wholly alien.</p>
        <p>Many believe Weyland-Yutani and other corporations are
            covertly developing new and dangerous biological weapons,
            ranging from plagues and drug-controlled psychopathic cyborgs
            to genetically-engineered monsters. If these weapons
            really are being developed, one has to wonder who the
            company is designing them for, and if a war is on the horizon.</p>
        <p>Over the past century, ships, stations, and even
            colonies have simply disappeared from the Frontier. Some
            attribute these losses to natural disasters or acts of God,
            others believe those involved fell prey to pirates or rival
            governments. Rumors of entire colonies being wiped out
            by a plague or nuked off the face of a planet have everyone
            on the Frontier living on the edge. Some even believe that
            man was never meant to leave Earth, and that space itself
            can swallow you whole.</p>
        <p>Shutter your storm blinds and seal the airlocks –
            something alien just might be out there, hiding in the dark.</p>
        <p>It’s waiting for you.</p>

        <h2>Here Are The Facts</h2>
        <p>It’s the 2180s – only a few years have passed since the
            destruction of the Hadley’s Hope colony on LV-426, the
            disappearance of the USS Sulaco, and the closing of the
            prison and lead works on Fiorina 161. The loss of the Sulaco’s
            Colonial Marine unit along with these Weyland-Yutani
            sponsored outposts, and the implications of corporate foul
            play stemming from these incidents, have created an air of
            distrust between the company and the United Americas.
            Many Frontier worlds have found themselves caught in the
            middle of this rift and have been forced to make do without
            either the supplies or defenses they need to survive.</p>

        <h3>Crew Expendable:</h3> The only publicly made exposition of
        these events deals with the aftermath on Fiorina 161. The
        book is titled Space Beast and is convict Robert Morse’s
        alleged account of an alien “dragon” that overran the facility
        and brutally slew two dozen double-Y chromo inmates and
        their custodial staff.</p>
        <p>The book gives credence both to talk of monsters
            and to rumors of Weyland-Yutani experimentation with
            bioweapons – indicating they were more concerned
            about securing the creature for further study than saving
            lives. According to Morse, the hunt to capture the beast
            had spilled over from the incident on LV-426, and anyone
            who got in the Company’s way was expendable – be they
            prisoners, soldiers, employees, or even colonists.</p>
        <p>Although banned instantly, copies of Space Beast have
            been transmitted illegally throughout the colonies. The
            book has developed a strong following. Some see it as a
            fantasy, a welcome diversion from their normal lives. Others
            have embraced Morse’s story and built a millenarian cult
            around it – believing it to be a religious text and a portent
            of the Armageddon to come.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>This Time It’s War:</h3> To add fuel to the fire, conflicts
        between the rival sectors of space have increased
        exponentially in the past five years. While unconfirmed,
        many believe that Hadley’s Hope was a test site for one
        of Weyland-Yutani’s bioweapons and that an enemy state
        sent a warship to nuke it from orbit. Others believe that the
        Company is working with a rogue nation to assume control
        of the colonies on the Frontier.</p>
        <p>As more and more Colonial Marine units are recalled
            and re-deployed to new campaigns, Frontier colonists are
            becoming scared. Without the military, there is no-one to
            protect them from pirates, hostile lifeforms, or invasion.
            To compensate, many colonies have enacted their own
            law systems, electing Marshals to oversee daily law
            enforcement. Some have even hired mercenary forces to
            protect their interests.</p>
        <p>The 2180s are a dangerous time to be alive.</p>

        <h1>CAREERS ON THE FRONTIER</h1>

        <h2>Space Truckers</h2>
        <p>While not as lucrative a field as it was some fifty years ago,
            hauling refineries and cargo between Earth and the colonies
            is still big business. The advent of newer and faster FTL drives
            has significantly shortened the travel time between worlds,
            ensuring that starship crews don’t have to spend nearly as
            much time in stasis. Most companies compensate their crews
            not only for their work but for time lost in hypersleep as well.</p>
        <p>
            While most space truckers work for one corporation
            or another, there are also independent trader captains,
            smugglers, salvage crews, and privateers. Space is big and,
            legally or off the books, people and things always need to
            get from one side of it to the other.</p>
        <p>
        <h2>Colonial Marines</h2>
        <p>The United States Colonial Marine Corps represents
            the finest fighting force ever assembled. Technologically
            advanced and sporting all the latest in military hardware
            – a large amount of which is designed by Weyland-Yutani –
            the Colonial Marines are able to operate independently in
            nearly any environment. Combat teams are cross-trained
            and can be deployed at a moment’s notice to nearly any
            world without extensive briefing.</p>
        <p>
            Military occupations include vehicle operators and pilots,
            combat technicians, heavy weapons specialists, medics,
            engineers, and career officers. Naval occupations are found
            in the USCM support service of warship and starfighter
            teams of the United Americas Outer Rim Defense Fleet,
            and there are military R&D programs. On the Frontier, there
            is always something that needs defending and some planet
            that needs pacifying.</p>

        <h2>Frontier Colonists</h2>
        <p>To most, becoming a colonist means you accept a hard
            life with little reward other than the satisfaction of a job
            well done. A colonist’s hands are always dirty and their
            feet are always tired. Living on the edge of civilization can
            have its benefits, however. Depending on your profession,
            the chance to strike it big could be right around the corner.
            Frontier Colonists are scouts and homesteaders, farmers
            and scientists, miners and doctors. Colonial Marshals keep
            the peace and Frontier journalists keep the colonies in the
            know. Colonists are the lifeblood of humanity.</p>
        <h2>Company Reps</h2>
        <p>Corporations have more power than governments on the
            Frontier. They own worlds, set up shop, and bring in the
            colonists, creating homes and jobs. From CEOs to field
            agents, each company sends out its own representatives to
            oversee their business ventures. Companies like Weyland-
            Yutani have been known to employ their own commando
            security teams, doctors, and scientists as well.</p>
        <p>
            Also, there is big business in knowing your competitors’
            next move – so many corporations have their own counterintelligence
            personnel embedded in rival companies and
            governments. Being a company rep is all about the art of the
            deal and making sure the little people around you do their jobs
            so that you can make your next promotion.</p>

        <h1>ROLEPLAYING ALIEN</h1>
        <p><strong>EACH PLAYER IN THIS GAME</strong> – except one – takes the role
            of a player character (PC). You might be a space colonist,
            a space trucker, a marine, or something else. You decide
            what your PC thinks and feels, what they say and do – but
            not what happens to them.</p>
        <p>
            It’s your job as a player to portray your PC and imagine
            yourself in their boots. Your PC is a person with feelings
            and dreams, just like yourself. Try to imagine – how would
            you react if you were in their place? What would you do?
            The player characters are always the protagonists of the
            story. The game is about you. Your decisions, your story.</p>
        <h2>The Game Mother</h2>
        <p>The final player is the Game Mother, or GM for short.
            She describes the ALIEN universe to you. She portrays
            all the people and creatures you meet during the game.
            Characters controlled by the GM are called non-player
            characters, or NPCs for short.</p>
        <p>
            The game is a conversation between the players and the
            GM, back and forth, until a critical situation arises where
            the outcome is uncertain. Then it’s time to break out the
            dice – read more about this in chapter 3.</p>
        <p>
            It is the GM’s job to put obstacles in your path and
            challenge your PCs, forcing them to show what they’re really
            made of. But it is not up to the GM to decide what happens in
            the game – and above all, not how your story is supposed to
            end. That is decided in the game. That is why you are playing
            the game, to find out how your story ends.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Being A Game Mother:</h3> A wide range of information and
        tools for the Game Mother can be found in the chapter 7.</p>

        <h1>GAME MODES</h1>
        <p><strong>THE ALIEN ROLEPLAYING GAME</strong> can be played in two
            distinct modes: cinematic play and campaign play. These
            modes are each designed to create a different experience
            for you. Even some rules of the game only apply to one
            of the two game modes – such rules are marked with the
            symbol of each game mode (see below).</p>
        <h2>Cinematic Play</h2>
        <p>A cinematic adventure emulates the dramatic arc of an
            ALIEN film. Designed to be played in a single session, this
            game mode emphasizes high stakes and fast and brutal
            play. Conflict between player characters is likely, and you
            are not all expected to survive. In fact, most of your PCs
            probably won’t live to see the end of the adventure.</p>
        <p>
            A three-act complete cinematic adventure, Rapture
            Protocol, is available for separate purchase. A quick taste
            of cinematic play can be found in the Hope’s Last Day
            Starter Set, available separately, as well as the Draconis
            Saga trilogy published for the first edition of the ALIEN
            RPG (but compatible with this Evolved Edition). All
            cinematic adventures include pre-generated characters.</p>
        <h2>Campaign Play</h2>
        <p>Campaign play is designed for longer continuous play with
            the same cast of player characters over several game
            sessions, possibly even dozens of sessions. In campaign
            play, you create your own PCs, using the rules in chapter 2.
            Campaign play can also be brutal and deadly, but the
            chances for your PCs to survive a night of play are generally
            higher than in cinematic play.</p>
        <p>
            In campaign play, the narrative of the game is to a
            higher degree controlled by the GM and the players
            themselves. You decide where to go and what to do,
            based on who your PCs are and what they want. The
            ALIEN roleplaying game supports three different
            campaign frameworks:</p>

        <ul class="alien-chevron-list">
            <li>Space Truckers</li>
            <li>Colonial Marines</li>
            <li>Frontier Colonists</li>
        </ul>

        <p>More information about these campaign frameworks, and
            tools for how to run them, can be found in chapter 7. Two
            expansion sourcebooks for campaign play – the Colonial
            Marines Operations Guide and Building Better Worlds
            – have been published for the first edition of the ALIEN
            roleplaying game and are compatible with the Evolved
            Edition.</p>

        <h1>KEY THEMES</h1>
        <p><strong>NO MATTER IF YOU PLAY</strong> cinematic or campaign play,
            any game of ALIEN is based on three key themes. Most
            adventures and campaigns contain a mix of these themes,
            but each adventure typically emphasizes one theme more
            than the others.</p>
        <h2>Space Horror</h2>
        <p>The ALIEN experience is rooted in a pervasive darkness
            and tension, with a capacity to shock by tapping into our
            primal fears. Every desperate breath into the rebreather
            of your space suit may be your last.</p>
        <h2>Sci-Fi Action</h2>
        <p>Whether it’s on an intimate or sprawling scale, roller coaster
            action – often with bloody results – is essential to many
            ALIEN stories. This game includes robust mechanics
            designed for fast and brutal combat.</p>
        <h2>Sense Of Wonder</h2>
        <p>The ALIEN roleplaying game lets you discover strange
            worlds and ancient, incomprehensible artifacts on a grand
            scale. Many ALIEN stories grapple with questions of
            humanity’s creation, destiny, and place in the universe.</p>

        <h2>TOOLS OF THE GAME</h2>
        <p><strong>ALIEN ROLEPLAYING GAME</strong> requires you to improvise
            as you play, but the game also provides a number of tools
            to help you create your story.</p>
        <h2>Character Sheets</h2>
        <p>To document your character, whether it’s a pre-generated
            PC from a cinematic adventure or a character you create
            for campaign play, you use a character sheet. Filled-in
            character sheets are included in cinematic adventures,
            and you can download blank character sheets from the
            official website alien-rpg.com.</p>
        <h2>Dice</h2>
        <p>In the ALIEN universe, nowhere is safe. Sooner or later, you
            will end up in situations where the outcome is uncertain, no
            matter how skilled you are. It’s time to break out the dice.</p>
        <p>There are two types of custom six-sided dice for this
            game, each available separately and included in the Hope’s
            Last Day Starter Set: base dice (black) and stress dice
            (yellow). You roll the dice when you perform a dramatic
            action that might decide if your PC lives or dies.</p>
        <p>Both base dice and stress dice have the <span class="alien-dice-success"></span> symbol on
            the 6 side. Rolling <span class="alien-dice-success"></span> usually means that a positive effect of
            some kind is triggered, such as succeeding at using a skill.
            Stress dice also have the <span class="alien-dice-stress-failure"></span> symbol on the 1 side. Rolling
            <span class="alien-dice-stress-failure"></span> can trigger panic or other adverse effects. For more on
            rolling dice, see chapter 3.
        </p>
        <p>Note: You can play this game with any normal six-sided
            dice, but it helps if you have them in two different colors.</p>

        <div class="alien-info-box-tab">
            <div class="alien-info-box-tab-header">Measuring Time</div>
            <p>Three separate units of time are typically used in the
                game, depending on the situation at hand. See the
                table below. The exact duration of a combat round,
                stretch and shift can vary depending on the situation.</p>
            <table class="alien-table">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>UNIT</th>

                        <td>Stretch</td>
                        <td>5-10 minutes</td>
                        <td>Stealth</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Shift</td>
                        <td>5-10 hours</td>
                        <td>Recovery</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            <p><strong>Countdowns:</strong> During a countdown to some catastrophic
                event, dice rolls can be used to regulate the
                passage of time. For more on this, see page 55.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="alien-info-box-top-border">
            <div class="alien-info-box-title">Rolling dice</div>
            <p>The rules sometimes ask you to roll D6, D3, 2D6
                and D66. D6 means rolling a base die and reading
                the number, ignoring any symbols. D3 means you
                roll a D6 and divide the result by two, rounding up.
                2D6 means you roll two D6 and add the results.
                Another type of roll is the D66, which means you
                roll two D6s – consider the first die as the tens digit
                and the second die the ones digit. That gives you a
                result between 11 and 66.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Cards</h2>
        <p>For the ALIEN roleplaying game, there is a custom card
            deck available in the Hope’s Last Day Starter Set. These
            cards are used for several purposes, such as drawing
            initiative in combat and tracking stress and panic effects.
            The custom cards are not required to play the game, but
            they are a useful supplement.</p>
        <h2>Safety Tools</h2>
        <p>The ALIEN RPG is a horror game and getting a good scare is
            part of the fun. That said, this is still a game, and no players
            should be forced to deal with topics they find distressing in
            real life, or that make them feel unsafe at the table.</p>
        <p>
            To make sure everyone is having fun and feeling safe,
            we recommend that you use safety tools before, during,
            and after the game. Examples of such safety tools are pregame
            discussions about lines and veils for subjects that
            players want to avoid or keep off-screen, safety cards to
            be shown during play by a player to indicate that they feel
            uncomfortable with what is happening in the game, and
            post-game debriefings.</p>
        <p>
            Always respect any player’s wish to raise a concern at
            any time during the game or even to leave the table if they
            want to. And don’t forget to take breaks. More information
            about safety tools in tabletop roleplaying can be found
            online.</p>

        <h1>SO WHAT IS A ROLEPLAYING GAME?</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>IF YOU HAVE MADE YOUR WAY HERE</strong> without knowing
            what a roleplaying game is, congratulations! Welcome to
            a rewarding and creative hobby. Roleplaying is a unique
            form of gaming that combines tabletop gaming with
            storytelling. Roleplaying games give you a set of rules and
            let you create your own story with your friends in a way that
            books, movies, TV, and even video games cannot.
        </p>
        <p>
            This unique feature of a roleplaying game can also be
            its challenge – the freedom to create the story yourselves
            can be overwhelming. To help you, you have the rules in
            this book and a host of tools and resources for the Game
            Mother in chapter 7. A great starting point is the Hope’s
            Last Day Starter Set.</p>
        <p>
            If you need advice or ideas, there is a range of online
            groups for the ALIEN roleplaying game, including the official
