        <p><strong>YOUR PLAYER CHARACTER (PC)</strong> is your most important
            asset in the ALIEN roleplaying game. They are your avatar
            in the game world. They are your eyes and ears out there
            in the deepest dark of space. You munch on popcorn with
            friends and roll dice while they take all the risks. There is
            an unwritten binding agreement between you two, and like
            any corporate contract, there is a catch. You live vicariously
            through them, and they, in return, depend on you to keep
            them alive.</p>

        <p>
        <h3>Don’t screw it up.</h3> Take your PC seriously. As far as you
        are concerned, they are a real person – and their fate is
        in your hands. No matter what you do, keep in mind your
        character’s goals, hopes, and agenda. They may differ from
        your personal beliefs, but that’s okay – you’re playing a
        character and this is a game. When a Xenomorph looms
        over them, your character may be terrified even when you
        aren’t. At all times, ask yourself, “what would my PC do?”
        and have them act accordingly.</p>
        <p>That said, don’t try to protect your character from every
            conceivable danger. The goal of any ALIEN game is twofold
            – go on a suspense-filled thrill ride and create a damn good
            story. For that to happen you need to roll the dice, both
            figuratively and literally. You need to take risks. But make
            the risks count for something.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Character Sheet:</h3> To keep track of your character’s game
        stats, you need a character sheet. You can photocopy it
        from the back of this book, or download it from the Free
        League website and print it.</p>
        <h2>Cinematic Play</h2>
        <p>In pre-made cinematic adventures, such as Rapture
            Protocol and the Hope’s Last Day Starter Set, the player
            characters are already provided for you. All you need to
            do is decide who plays which character. If you can’t agree
            on who to play, roll dice for it.</p>
        <p>The rules for creating characters in this chapter can still
            be useful when creating your own cinematic adventures.
            You can even create your characters first and let the GM
            design a cinematic adventure for them.</p>

        <div class="alien-info-box-tab">
            <div class="alien-info-box-tab-header">Creating Your Character</div>
            <p>How you create your player character is explained
                in detail in this chapter. Grab a character sheet,
                a pencil, and follow these steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Choose your career.</li>
                <li>Determine your attributes.</li>
                <li>Determine your skills.</li>
                <li>Choose your career talent.</li>
                <li>Choose your name.</li>
                <li>Decide on your appearance.</li>
                <li>Decide on your personal agenda.</li>
                <li>Choose your buddy and rival.</li>
                <li>Pick your gear and a signature item.</li>
                <li>Roll for cash.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <h2>Campaign Play</h2>
        <p>For campaign play, you create your player character
            yourself, using the process outlined here. During the course
            of a campaign, your PC changes and develops. Your skills
            and talents can be developed through experience, but you
            can also discover how your PC’s personality changes and
            grows in a way that cannot be measured by numbers on a
            page. This is when your character truly comes alive.
            Campaign Frameworks: Before creating characters,
            you should decide together as a group on a campaign
            framework, i.e. which type of people you will be playing.
            Three suggested campaign frameworks are described on
            page 16, and GM tools for playing each of them are
            available in chapter 7.</p>
        <ul class="alien-chevron-list">
            <li>Space Truckers</li>
            <li>Colonial Marines</li>
            <li>Frontier Colonists</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="alien-info-box-top-border">
            <div class="alien-info-box-title">The Life Path Method</div>
            <p>The basic method of character creation described
                here lets you create a PC quickly. If you want to spend
                more time fleshing out your character’s past life, you
                can instead use the life path method outlined at the
                end of this book, on page 282.</p>
            <p>
                This method lets you develop your backstory in
                detail, learning skills and specialties as you go along.
                Note that using the life path method can result in less
                balanced characters, as there are elements of chance
                involved.</p>
        </div>

        <h1>CORE CONCEPTS</h1>
        <h2>Career</h2>
        <p>The first choice for your character is your career. Your
            career choice determines your background and your
            role in the group. It influences your attributes, your skills,
            your starting gear and what starting talent you can have.
            There are nine core careers to choose from, described
            on pages 31–39.</p>
        <p>Career descriptions can feel stereotypical, and they
            are meant to. Picking a career is a quick way for you –
            and the other players – to get an immediate feel for your
            character. But remember that your character is more than
            just a career. Your career is merely a starting point toward
            creating a unique player character.</p>

        <div class="alien-info-box-top-border">
            <div class="alien-info-box-title">Random Attributes</div>
            <p>If you prefer a faster and more random approach,
                creating more varied characters, you can roll dice
                to determine your attributes. To do so, roll four
                dice. Re-roll all 1s and 6s until all dice show 2–5.
                Then assign the scores to the four attributes.
                Using the random method, you can have a score
                of 5 in more than one attribute, but if so, one of
                them must be the key attribute for your career.
                For androids, add +2 to Strength and Wits and
                reduce Empathy by –1 after distributing the
                random rolls.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Attributes</h2>
        <p>You have four attributes that indicate your core physical
            and mental capabilities, each rated on a scale from 1 to 5.
            Your attributes are used when you roll dice to perform
            actions in the game, and to determine how much damage
            you can withstand.</p>
        <ul class="alien-chevron-list">
            <li><strong>STRENGTH:</strong> Raw physical power and endurance.</li>
            <li><strong>AGILITY:</strong> Speed, body control and motor skills.</li>
            <li><strong>WITS:</strong> Intelligence, alertness and sharpness of mind.</li>
            <li><strong>EMPATHY:</strong> Charisma and ability to read and affect
                others.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Starting Attributes: To create your character, distribute
            a total of 14 points across your attributes. You may assign
            no less than 2 and no more than 4 points to any one
            attribute – except the key attribute for your career which
            can have a score of 5.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Androids:</h3> Synthetic characters get a +3 bonus to two
        attributes of their choice after the 14 attribute points have
        been assigned, and can reach a maximum score of 8 in
        the key attribute and 7 in another. However, androids have
        other drawbacks. See below. </p>

        <div class="alien-info-box-top-border">
            <div class="alien-info-box-title">Playing an Android</div>
            <p>Androids are an important part of the ALIEN
                universe, and you can play one as your player
                character. Androids are rare, however, and we
                recommend that you talk it through with the
                rest of the group before creating an android PC.
                The follow special rules apply for androids:</p>
            <ul class="alien-chevron-list">
                <li>Androids get a +3 bonus to two attributes of
                    their choice after the 14 attribute points have
                    been assigned.</li>
                <li>Androids can’t push skill rolls (page 43).</li>
                <li>Androids don’t suffer stress and don’t have
                    a stress level (page 72).</li>
                <li>Androids never make panic rolls.</li>
                <li>Androids suffer damage differently (page 78).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            <h3>Secret Androids:</h3> Most androids look human.
            They can have any career and may be open about
            their nature or secretly pose as human. If you
            play a secret android, you may roll fewer dice for
            your attributes and even make fake stress and
            panic rolls to avoid suspicion. Make sure you talk it
            over with the GM beforehand if you want to play a
            secret android.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>Your skills represent the knowledge you have acquired
            during your life. They determine, along with your attributes,
            how effectively you can perform certain actions in the game.
            There are twelve core skills in the game, all described in detail
            in chapter 3. Skills are measured by a skill level from 0 to 5.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>No Skill Level?</h3> You can always roll for a skill even if you
        have no level in that skill. In that case, you only roll for the
        relevant attribute plus any modifiers from relevant gear.
        Read more about how skills work in the next chapter.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Starting Skill Levels:</h3> To create your PC, distribute a
        total of 10 points across the twelve skills. The skills listed
        by your career can have a starting level up to 3. Other skills
        can start no higher than level 1. You can increase your skill
        levels during the game (page 30).</p>
        <h2>Talents</h2>
        <p>Talents are tricks, moves, and minor abilities that give you a
            small edge. They are more specialized than skills and make
            your character unique. Read more in chapter 3.
            Starting Talent: When creating your character, you get
            one talent at the start of the game. Your career offers three
            talents to choose from. You can learn more talents during
            the course of the game (page 30).</p>
        <h2>Stress</h2>
        <p>Life in space is lethal. More often than you’d like, you’ll
            find yourself under extreme pressure. In the game, this
            mounting tension is represented by your stress level. It
            usually starts at zero, and can increase by pushing dice rolls
            (page 43) and by experiencing terrifying or stressful
            situations. Stress is explained further in chapter 4.</p>
        <h2>Resolve</h2>
        <p>To keep your nerves in check, you need Resolve – a
            numerical rating equal to your Wits plus Empathy scores
            divided by two (round fractions up). Your Resolve can be
            increased by the Seen It All talent. You use your Resolve
            score to resist stress (page 44) and panic (page 72).</p>
        <h2>Health</h2>
        <p>Even if you keep your nerves in check, chances are that
            sooner or later you’re going to get hurt. This is tracked
            using your Health score.</p>
        <p>Health is reduced by taking damage. When your Health
            is reduced to zero, you’re broken and might die – read more
            in chapter 4. Your starting maximum Health equals your
            Strength plus Agility scores divided by two (round fractions
            up) but can be increased by the Hardened talent.</p>

        <h1>PERSONAL STUFF</h1>
        <h2>Name</h2>
        <p>Your character needs a name. Each career has a list of six
            names that are typical for that archetype. Choose one of
            these names, or make up your own if you prefer. Cinematic
            adventures will include the names of the pre-generated
            characters.</p>
        <h2>Appearance</h2>
        <p>Describe your player character’s appearance in a few words.
            Your career gives you a few suggestions, but you are free to
            choose any appearance that you think fits your character.</p>
        <h2>Personal Agenda</h2>
        <p>You might be a team, but each individual PC in your group
            also has an angle of their own – a personal agenda. How
            personal agendas work differs between cinematic and
            campaign play.</p>

        <div class="alien-info-box-tab">
            <div class="alien-info-box-tab-header">Player versus Player</div>
            <p>In the ALIEN roleplaying game, your PC can end
                up in direct confrontation with another PC. This
                is quite common in cinematic play, less so in
                campaign play.</p>
            <p>In cinematic play, it’s up to the GM to call out
                when a player versus player situation escalates
                beyond the point of no return. When the GM has
                “called PvP,” the players involved play out the
                current conflict to its conclusion. After that, the
                PC who has “turned traitor,” if they are still alive,
                becomes an NPC and is from now on under the
                control of the GM. The player in question is given
                a new PC to play, if one is available.</p>
            <p>This means that you should think very carefully
                before acting against the common interest of
                the group, even if you think it’s in line with your
                personal agenda – it may cost you your PC. You
                are strongly recommended to wait until the third
                and final act of the scenario before taking such
                drastic action.</p>
            <p>In campaign play, PvP is less common and any
                such situations are resolved in the group without
                specific rules – you’ll just need to work out your
                differences if you are to continue in the same crew
                of PCs.</p>
        </div>

        <p>
        <h3>Cinematic Agendas:</h3> In cinematic play, the PCs’
        agendas are predetermined by the adventure. At the
        beginning of each of the three acts of the adventure, the
        GM gives each PC a handout with a new agenda for the
        act. The agendas are hidden, you should not show them to
        other players or write them down on your character sheet.</p>
        <p>At the end of each act, the GM evaluates the actions of
            each PC. If you took any specific actions to further your
            agenda during the act, you are awarded one story point
            (page 44). Acts, agendas, and story points are further
            explained in detail in chapter 7.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Campaign Agendas:</h3> In campaign play, you can pick
        one of the suggested personal agendas listed with your
        career, or you can come up with an agenda of your own.
        At the end of each game session, discuss the agendas of
        all PCs together. If you have taken some concrete action
        to further your agenda during the session, despite risk or
        cost, you gain a bonus experience point (page 30).</p>
        <h2>Buddies & Rivals</h2>
        <p>The ALIEN roleplaying game is about a small group of
            people facing unknown and horrifying dangers in the cold
            darkness of space. To survive, you need to find someone
            to trust, but also be careful who you turn your back to.</p>
        <p>Your PC can have one buddy and one rival amongst the
            other PCs. In game terms, you can only have one of each.
            Your relationships are important for the GM, as she can use
            them to create interesting situations in the game.</p>
        <p>In campaign play, you can choose one PC to be your
            buddy and another to be your rival. In cinematic adventures,
            the choice is made for you.</p>

        <h1>YOUR GEAR</h1>
        <p><strong>TO SURVIVE THE WORLD OF ALIEN</strong>, you need the right
            gear. An M314 Motion Tracker or an M41A Pulse Rifle can
            truly mean the difference between life and death for your
            character. You can find lots of gear described in detail
            in chapter 5. You must write down all the items you are
            carrying on your character sheet. If it’s not listed on your
            sheet, you don’t have it with you.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Starting Gear:</h3> In cinematic play, the adventure determines
        what gear you start the game with. In campaign play,
        your career gives you gear to choose or roll for. If you get a
        weapon, you always get two full reloads for it. In addition,
        you are assumed to have a uniform or civilian clothing. You
        also get some W-Y dollars – the career indicates how much.
        Read more about cash and how to spend it in chapter 6.</p>

        <p>
        <h3>Signature Item:</h3> In addition to your normal gear, you also
        have a signature item – a small item that’s of no practical
        use, but that has sentimental value to you and that says
        something about your character. Signature items are
        usually tiny (see below) and thus don’t encumber you at
        all. Common examples include a patch, a cap, or a photo
        of a loved one.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Vehicles & Spaceships:</h3> In some cinematic adventures,
        your PCs have a vehicle or even a spacecraft. Usually,
        vehicles and starships don’t belong to one individual
        character – instead, they are crewed by the entire group
        of PCs together. In campaign play, it’s also possible for your
        group to begin the game with a vehicle or a ship. Read more
        about this in chapter 6.</p>

        <h2>Encumbrance</h2>
        <p>You can carry a number of regular-sized items equal to
            double your Strength rating without problems. A regular
            item (weight 1 in the gear lists in chapter 5) is generally the
            size of a small bag weighing no more than a few kilos, and
            takes up one row on your character sheet.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Heavy & Light Items:</h3> Especially heavy or bulky items
        count as two or more regular items, and thus take up several
        rows on your character sheet. At the opposite end of the
        spectrum, light items count as ½ or even ¼ of a regular
        item, and several of these can fit on the same row on the
        character sheet. The gear lists in chapter 5 indicate the
        weight of every item. If you are uncertain about the weight
        of an item, assume it is 1 or let the GM decide.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Tiny Items:</h3> Items that are even smaller than light items
        are called tiny. They are so small they don’t affect your
        encumbrance at all. The rule of thumb is: if the item can
        be hidden in a closed fist, it’s tiny. Tiny items also need to
        be listed on your character sheet.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Over-Encumbered:</h3> You can temporarily carry up to twice
        your normal encumbrance limit, i.e. Strength × 4 regular items.
        When doing so, your stress level (page 72) increases one
        step every time you move in a stretch of stealth mode (page
        55) or a round of combat (page 61).</p>
        <h2>Consumables</h2>
        <p>In the world of ALIEN, you need to overcome a lot
            more than Xenomorph life forms to survive. Lack of air,
            ammunition, and electric power can be just as deadly.
            These are all called consumables. The space suits
            you’ll find in chapter 5 have an air rating, weapons have
            an ammo rating, and some types of gear have a power
            rating. Collectively, these are called supply ratings and
            are tracked on your character sheet.</p>

        <div class="alien-info-box-top-border">
            <div class="alien-info-box-title">Time as a consumable</div>
            <p>During a countdown to some catastrophic event,
                time itself can be treated as a consumable.
                The GM or the adventure text sets the timer to
                a certain number of minutes. After each combat
                round, a supply roll is made. For each <span class="alien-dice-stress-failure"></span> rolled,
                the number of minutes remaining is reduced by
                one. For more on this, see page 55.</p>
        </div>

        <p>
        <h3>Supply Roll:</h3> At certain intervals, you need to make supply
        rolls for your gear. This means rolling a number of stress
        dice equal to the current air, ammo or power rating, up to a
        maximum of six dice. For every <span class="alien-dice-stress-failure"></span> rolled, the supply rating
        of the item is decreased by one.</p>
        <ul class="alien-chevron-list">
            <li><strong>AIR:</strong> Make a supply roll after every stretch of time, and
                after strenuous activity like combat or a MOBILITY roll.
                When your air supply rating reaches zero, you’re entering
                a world of hurt (page 75).</li>
            <li><strong>AMMO:</strong> Most firearms have magazines with a supply of
                ammunition. After firing your weapon, make a supply roll.
                When your ammo runs out, you need to reload (page 67).</li>
            <li><strong>POWER:</strong> Some items require electricity to function. After
                each use, or as indicated by the item description, you
                need to make a supply roll. When the power runs out,
                the item cannot function.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        <h3>NPCs:</h3> To avoid excessive dice rolling, we recommend that
        the GM does not make supply rolls for NPCs. Instead, the
        supply rating for NPCs is simply reduced one step each time
        a supply roll would be made. The GM is free to make a supply
        roll for an NPC when dramatically appropriate, however.</p>

        <div class="alien-info-box-top-border">
            <div class="alien-info-box-title">Supply dial</div>
            <p>The Hope’s Last Day Starter Set includes a useful
                supply dial, which you can use to track any kind of
                consumable supply rating instead of marking them
                on your character sheet.</p>

                to zero. Note that the supply rating will decrease
                faster when it’s high than when it’s low. This is
                intentional, to increase the dramatic tension as
                a supply rating gets closer to zero.</p>

        <h1>DEVELOPING YOUR CHARACTER</h1>
        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>One of the most rewarding things in campaign play is
            watching your character grow and develop. The harsh
            realities of life will change you, that’s all you can be certain
            of in an uncertain world. You can develop your character
            in several different ways during the game.
            The things you learn during the game are measured
            in experience points (XP). You receive XP after the end
            of each game session. Talk it through and let the whole
            group discuss what has happened. For each of the below
            questions that you can reply “yes” to, you get one XP:</p>
        <ul class="alien-chevron-list">
            <li>Did you participate in the game session?
                You get one XP just for being there.</li>
            <li>Did you risk or sacrifice something to further
                your personal agenda?</li>
            <li>Did you risk your life for your buddy PC?</li>
            <li>Did you challenge or stand up to your rival PC?</li>
            <li>Did you make a panic roll?</li>
            <li>Did you overcome a dangerous event, using violent or
                non-violent means?</li>
            <li>Did you make a significant discovery or revelation?</li>
            <li>Did you perform an extraordinary action of some kind?</li>
            <li>Did you earn any money?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You can only get one XP per question. Sometimes, the
            answers are not clear-cut. Discuss within the group, and
            try to reach a consensus. If you can’t, the GM has final say.
            Once you’ve determined how much XP your character has
            earned, write the amount down on your character sheet.</p>
        <h2>Spending XP</h2>
        <p>You can use your XP to improve your skills and talents, or to
            learn new ones. You can only spend XP between sessions.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Skills:</h3> To increase a skill level by one step costs a number
        of XP equal to the skill level you want to attain multiplied
        by 5. For example, an increase from skill level 2 to 3 costs
        15 XP. You can only increase a skill level one step at a time.</p>
        <p>Learning a new skill (at skill level 1) costs 5 XP. To do
            this, however, you must have either used the skill and
            succeeded (without skill level) during the session, or been
            instructed by a teacher for at least one shift of time. The
            teacher must have at least skill level 1.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Talents:</h3> Learning a new talent always costs 5 XP. You can
        choose new talents freely from among your career talents
        and the general talents described in chapter 3.</p>
        <h2>Changing Buddy & Rival</h2>
        <p>After the end of a game session, you are free to change
            your buddy and rival PCs as you see fit.</p>

        <div class="alien-h1-pre-header">Career:</div>
        <h1>COLONIAL MARINE</h1>
        <p>Most of your friends will never see another world … but
            not you. As soon as you were old enough, you signed up
            for the USCMC. The pay is crap and the food is worse, but
            you’ve always got a bunk to sleep in and you get to shoot
            all sorts of weapons at all sorts of things. Life in the Corps
            is never dull – but the luster has begun to fade. You’ve seen
            things that you’ll never be able to forget, and plenty you
            wish you could.</p>

                    and everyone in Short range
                    drops two steps (instead of
                    one) for every stretch spent in a
                    safe place (page 73).</li>
                <li><strong>Overkill.</strong> When you roll 9 or
                    higher on a panic roll (page
                    72), you can ignore the result
                    and instead go into overkill. All
                    other PCs in the same zone must
                    make an immediate panic roll.
                    While in overkill, you must attack
                    your enemies on every turn and
                    you cannot take cover, dodge, or
                    defend yourself against attacks.

                    a supply roll for ammo (page

                    fewer than your ammo supply
                    rating, to a minimum of one die.</li>

        <h1>COLONIAL MARSHAL</h1>
        <p>The Frontier can be a lawless place. The Colonial Marines
            are spread thin – they have neither the time nor inclination to
            mete out local justice. Not to worry – there’s a new sheriff in
            town, and that’s you. Most law enforcement officers on the
            Frontier are firmly planted deep in the back pocket of one
            company or another – but not you. You don’t take bribes and
            you never look the other way. You’ve made a lot of enemies
            on both sides of the law, but your colony has the lowest
            crime rate in the system. It’s only a matter of time before you
            piss off the wrong CEO and corporate sends someone to
            take care of you, but that’s okay. You’ll be ready.

            score a win for the company and use it to catapult yourself
            up the corporate ladder. You tend not to form long-lasting
            attachments, instead viewing everybody as a commodity
            to capitalize on. Worry about others later. Right now, it’s all

            medicine, but you’ve seen enough to become jaded. Too
            many people in the Outer Veil are addicted to painkillers, and

        <p>When everything is going to shit – the Company’s holding
            your crew’s pay hostage, there’s a mountain of reports to
            file from that last incident near Thedus, and who knows
            how many family members back home are weighing on
            everyone’s minds – it’s a good thing you spent all those
            years training to do this for a living. You’re the authority
            figure, the role model, the voice of your superiors, and the
            enlisted crew’s advocate. You’re also the butt of all of their
            jokes around the mess hall … until it all gets so much worse,
            and they’re looking to you for what to do next. Better hope

            passion is knowledge. Whether your field is xenobiology,
            astrophysics, robotics, or even archaeology, there are
            countless treasures in space, just waiting for someone to
            trip over the next asteroid and run right into them. Whether
            or not that’s you, you’re still the one who understands them
            better than anyone.</p>

                <li><strong>Analysis.</strong> You can roll for
                    <span class="alien-code">OBSERVATION</span> to gain insight
                    regarding strange and alien
                    artifacts or creatures that you
                    encounter. For every <span class="alien-dice-success"></span> you roll,
                    you get to ask the GM one of the
                    following questions: Is it human or
                    alien? Is it dead or alive? How old
                    is it? What is its purpose? How
                    does it work? What problems
                    could it cause? A successful roll
                    reduces the stress level of all
                    other PCs within Short range 1
                    step, while a failed roll increases
                    their stress levels by 1.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Inquisitive.</strong> You can push a skill
                    roll based on Wits twice. Stress
                    level +1 for each push.</li>
                <li><strong>Xenomorphology.</strong> When facing
                    an extraterrestrial creature
                    of any kind, you may make an
                    <span class="alien-code">OBSERVATION</span> roll (quick action).
                    If successful, you realize a potential
                    weakness of the creature, if
                    it has any. If you fail, gain stress
                    level +1. Only one attempt per
                    Xenomorph is allowed.
