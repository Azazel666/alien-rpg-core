        <h1>Weapons</h1>

        <p><strong>YOU ALWAYS WANT</strong> a weapon close at hand – you never
            know where danger lurks. Don’t expect to have your choice
            of firearms, however. When something hisses at you in
            the dark, you can’t be too choosy, understand? You use
            whatever you can get your hands on to buy you some time.
            The tables and images on the following pages show various
            kinds of common weapons.</p>

        <h2>Weapon Features</h2>
        <p>Different weapons neutralize different threats. This list is
            a heads-up on the features used in the weapon tables.</p>
        <ul class="alien-chevron-list">
            <li>
                <p>
                <h3>Modifier:</h3> The modifier to <span class="alien-code">CLOSE COMBAT</span> or <span
                    class="alien-code">RANGED
                    COMBAT</span> when using the weapon.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                <h3>Damage:</h3> The amount of damage inflicted on a
                successful attack. Extra
                rolled beyond the first
                increase the damage. The letter E by the number means
                that the attack is explosive (page 76). "Stun" means
                that the weapon inflicts stun damage (page 71)
                instead of regular damage.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                <h3>Range:</h3> The minimum / maximum range. Any attack
                closer than the minimum range gets –2 dice per range
                band below the minimum range. A weapon cannot be
                used beyond its maximum range.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                <h3>Ammo:</h3> The ammo supply rating of the weapon (page
                29). When the ammo supply rating runs out, you need
                to reload. "Single-shot" means the weapon needs to be
                reloaded (quick action) after each attack.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                <h3>Power:</h3> The power supply rating of the weapon (page
                29), if it has one. When the power supply runs out,
                the weapons needs to be recharged or reloaded.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                <h3>Weight:</h3> The number of rows the weapon requires in
                the inventory list. If the weight is indicated as N/A, the
                weapon is too heavy to be carried.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                <h3>Cost:</h3> The typical price in W-Y dollars. The actual price
                varies depending on the local supply and demand.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                <h3>Special:</h3> Any special effects of the weapon.</p>
                <p class="alien-indent-paragraph">Armor piercing means that all armor levels are
                    reduced 1 step against this weapon to a minimum of zero).</p>
                <p class="alien-indent-paragraph">Full auto means the weapon is capable of fully
                    automatic fire (page 67).</p>
                <p class="alien-indent-paragraph">Unreliable means that a Mess Up (7+) result on a
                    stress response roll causes a jam (in addition to other
                    effects). Clearing a jam is a full action and requires a
                    <span class="alien-code">HEAVY MACHINERY</span> roll.
                </p>

            <div class="alien-info-box-title">Ammo</div>
            <p>One full reload for a firearm typically costs about
                5% of the cost of the weapon itself. A reload typically
                has a weight of ¼. The ammo inside a loaded
                weapon is included in the weapon’s weight.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Handguns</h2>
        <h3>M4A3 Service Pistol</h3>
        <ul class="alien-chevron-list flex">
            <li class="half"><strong>Modifier</strong> +2</li>
            <li class="half"><strong>Ammo</strong> 2</li>

            <li class="half"><strong>Cost</strong> $200</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This inexpensive 9 mm
            pistol is the standard
            sidearm of the USCMC.
            You should always have a
            backup for your backup,
            and this pistol might as
            well be it.</p>

        <h3>VP-79MA6 Service Pistol</h3>
        <ul class="alien-chevron-list flex">
            <li class="half"><strong>Modifier</strong> +2</li>
            <li class="half"><strong>Ammo</strong> 2</li>

            <li class="half"><strong>Cost</strong> $250</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For nearly 70 years, the VP70
            series was only found in the
            hands of USCMC officers from
            key influential military families.
            Over the past decade, it has
            begun to supplant the outdated
            M4A3 as the standard marine
            sidearm.</p>

        <h3>.357 Magnum Revolver</h3>
        <ul class="alien-chevron-list flex">
            <li class="half"><strong>Modifier</strong> +1</li>
            <li class="half"><strong>Ammo</strong> 1</li>

            <li class="half"><strong>Weight</strong> 1</li>
            <li class="half"><strong>Range</strong> S/M</li>
            <li class="half"><strong>Cost</strong> $300</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A classic high caliber revolver, equally
            popular amongst both Frontier Marshals
            and lowlifes.</p>

        <h3>Watatsumi DV-303 Bolt Gun</h3>
        <ul class="alien-chevron-list flex">
            <li class="half"><strong>Modifier</strong> –1</li>
            <li class="half"><strong>Ammo</strong> Single-Shot</li>
            <li class="half"><strong>Damage</strong> 3</li>

            <li class="half"><strong>Range</strong> A/S</li>
            <li class="half"><strong>Cost</strong> $400</li>
            <li class="full"><strong>Special</strong> Armor piercing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The DV-303 is a construction tool that uses expanding
            bolts to make emergency hull repairs. The DV-303 can
            be turned into an improvised weapon – firing bolts like a
            single round shotgun – a trick first used by Frontier rebels
            in the early 2100s</p>

        <h3>Weyland ES-4 Electrostatic Pistol</h3>
        <ul class="alien-chevron-list flex">
            <li class="half"><strong>Modifier</strong> +1</li>
            <li class="half"><strong>Ammo</strong> 1</li>
            <li class="half"><strong>Damage</strong> 1 (stun)</li>
            <li class="half"><strong>Weight</strong> ½</li>
            <li class="half"><strong>Range</strong> S/M</li>
            <li class="half"><strong>Cost</strong> $1,000</li>
            <li class="full"><strong>Special</strong> Armor piercing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Developed a century ago, this electrostatic kinetic energy
            projectile weapon uses charged elements to fire high￾speed armor piercing rounds. The ES-4 has a tell-tale
            blue
            muzzle-flash when fired. While a quality weapon, the pistol
            fell out of use before the Weyland-Yutani merger due to its
            cost and upkeep requirements.</p>
        <p class="alien-indent-paragraph">While it can mostly be found in use amongst high level
            corporate security teams from the ICSC, a select number
            of Colonial Marshal offices are testing out a newer model
            as their standard sidearm on the Frontier – along with a
            pair of insulator gloves.</p>

        <h3>Rexim RXF-M55 EVA Pistol</h3>
        <ul class="alien-chevron-list flex">
            <li class="half"><strong>Modifier</strong> +1</li>
            <li class="half"><strong>Ammo</strong> 4</li>
            <li class="half"><strong>Damage</strong> 1</li>
            <li class="half"><strong>Weight</strong> ½</li>
            <li class="half"><strong>Range</strong> S/M</li>
            <li class="half"><strong>Cost</strong> $400</li>
            <li class="full"><strong>Special</strong> Armor piercing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A miniaturized and weaponized version of a Weyland￾Yutani laser welder in use from the 2100–2120s. This tool
            was originally improvised as a weapon by the J’Har rebels
            during the 2106 uprising on Torin Prime. Always one to find
            profit in anything, Weyland-Yutani studied the modifications
            after the war and made them the standard self-defense
            armament on their commercial fleet.</p>

        <h2>Rifles</h2>
        <h3>Armat M41A Pulse Rifle</h3>
        <ul class="alien-chevron-list flex">
            <li class="half"><strong>Modifier</strong> +2</li>
            <li class="half"><strong>Ammo</strong> 3</li>
            <li class="half"><strong>Damage</strong> 2</li>
            <li class="half"><strong>Weight</strong> 1</li>
            <li class="half"><strong>Range</strong> S/L</li>
            <li class="half"><strong>Cost</strong> $1,200</li>
            <li class="full"><strong>Special</strong> Armor piercing, full auto, grenade launcher</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The standard issue weapon of the USCMC, the M41A Pulse
            Rifle is a 10 mm automatic assault rifle with underslung
            30 mm pump-action grenade launcher combined in a
            sturdy housing with retractable stock and optional scope.</p>
        <p class="alien-indent-paragraph">The M41A fires explosive-tip caseless standard light
            armor-penetrating US M309 rounds accelerated via
            electronic pulse. Remaining ammo is tracked via an LED
            counter and the rifle has two firing modes – single-shot and
            fully automatic. For more about the grenade launcher, see
            the U1 on page 88.</p>

        <h3>F44AA Pulse Rifle</h3>
        <ul class="alien-chevron-list flex">
            <li class="half"><strong>Modifier</strong> +3</li>
            <li class="half"><strong>Ammo</strong> 3</li>
            <li class="half"><strong>Damage</strong> 2</li>
            <li class="half"><strong>Weight</strong> 1</li>
            <li class="half"><strong>Range</strong> S/L</li>
            <li class="half"><strong>Cost</strong> $1,500</li>
            <li class="full"><strong>Special</strong> Armor piercing, full auto, unreliable</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A precursor to the modern M41A
            that is almost obsolete but can still
            be found in the hands of smugglers
            and colonists. It comes equipped with
            “aiming assist,” where a targeting
            sight sends data via external cable
            to the dynamic rifle stock which then
            makes minor changes to improve
            accuracy. It includes an LED ammo
            counter and folding stock. Once the
            service rifle of the Marines, it was
            prone to malfunction, and so the
            targeting system was subsequently
            redeveloped for the then upcoming
            M56 smart gun.</p>

        <h3>AK-4047 Pulse Assault Rifle</h3>
        <ul class="alien-chevron-list flex">
            <li class="half"><strong>Modifier</strong> +1</li>
            <li class="half"><strong>Ammo</strong> 2</li>
            <li class="half"><strong>Damage</strong> 2</li>
            <li class="half"><strong>Weight</strong> 1</li>
            <li class="half"><strong>Range</strong> S/L</li>
            <li class="half"><strong>Cost</strong> $600</li>
            <li class="full"><strong>Special</strong> Armor piercing, full auto</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The UPP equivalent to the M41A
            Pulse Rifle, the AK-4047 is a cheap
            and reliable substitute. As such, the
            weapon often winds up in the hands
            of mercenaries and insurgents. While
            not as accurate as the M41A, the AK-
            4047 is sturdier than the USCMC
            weapon.</p>

        <h3>M42A Scope Rifle</h3>
        <ul class="alien-chevron-list flex">
            <li class="half"><strong>Modifier</strong> +3</li>
            <li class="half"><strong>Ammo</strong> 2</li>
            <li class="half"><strong>Damage</strong> 2</li>

            <li class="half"><strong>Range</strong> M/E</li>
            <li class="half"><strong>Cost</strong> $1,000</li>
            <li class="full"><strong>Special</strong> Armor piercing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Equipped with a folding bipod, muzzle flash suppressor, and
            a fully adjustable stock, the M42A is the USCMC’s semi￾automatic electronic pulse sniper rifle of choice.
            If you manage to see what’s lurking in the shadows before it sees
            you, you go ahead and take the shot.</p>

        <h3>Armat M41AE2 Heavy Pulse Rifle</h3>
        <ul class="alien-chevron-list flex">
            <li class="half"><strong>Modifier</strong> +2</li>
            <li class="half"><strong>Ammo</strong> 4</li>
            <li class="half"><strong>Damage</strong> 2</li>

            <li class="full"><strong>Special</strong> Armor piercing, full auto</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A USCMC Squad Automatic Weapon modification
            of the M41A, this electric pulse support rifle has a
            longer barrel in place of the U1 grenade launcher.
            This is the machinegun you want laying down
            suppressing fire to cover your ass during an evac.</p>

        <h3>M56 Smartgun</h3>
        <ul class="alien-chevron-list flex">
            <li class="half"><strong>Modifier</strong> +3</li>
            <li class="half"><strong>Ammo</strong> 3</li>
            <li class="half"><strong>Damage</strong> 3</li>

            <li class="half"><strong>Range</strong> S/L</li>

            <li class="full"><strong>Special</strong> Armor piercing, full auto, smart sight</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The heavy firepower of every USCMC squad, the M56 Smartgun
            is mounted on an articulating arm and gimbal attached to an
            armored harness worn by the weapon’s operator.</p>
        <p class="alien-indent-paragraph">What makes the M56A2 a smart gun is its ability to choose
            targets for you. It is equipped with an infrared tracking system
            and data transmitter/receiver that homes in on potential threats
            and sends that information to a Head Mounted Sight.</p>
        <p class="alien-indent-paragraph">The M56A2 fires in either bursts or full automatic. A glancing
            shot can sever a limb and a full burst can cut a person in half,
            so watch that friendly fire, Private.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Smart Sight:</h3> When firing the M56A2 on full auto after aiming
        carefully (page 64), the second and third burst of the attack
        will also gain the bonus for aiming.</p>

        <h2>Other Weapons</h2>
        <h3>Armat Model 37A2 12 Gauge Pump Action</h3>

        <p>A classic pump-action combat
            shotgun, the M37A2 is an optional
            weapon in use by the USCMC.
            Reliable and direct, the 37 is the
            gun you want to keep handy for

        <p>This carbine-style flamethrower uses
            naphtha fuel canisters to fire a thick,
            steady stream of flame at a target.
            It is in common use by the USCMC,
            who deploy the weapon at the squad
            and fireteam level. Civilian models
            exist too. The troops in the field have
            given the M240 the unceremonious
            nickname of “Bake-a-Flake.” It’s a
            good standby weapon to have in a
            pinch, especially when facing off
            against hostile organisms. Most
            animals retreat from fire, yes?</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Fire Effect:</h3> If hurt, the target contin￾ues to burn with intensity 9 fire (page
        76). Instead of hitting a specific
        target, the incinerator may be used
        to trigger intensity 9 fire in a zone.
        A single is needed in the attack roll.</p>

            <div class="alien-info-box-tab-header">Dirty Bullets</div>
            <p>Here’s where things start getting particularly nasty.
                The target of these radioactive bullets not only suffers
                piercing damage, but their wounds are irradiated in
                the process. Any ammunition type can be treated with
                radionuclides, but it’s going to run you four times the
                cost of normal ammo.</p>
            <p class="alien-indent-paragraph">Make sure you take the proper precautionary steps
                when using them—dirty bullets not only leave your
                gun glowing in the dark, but also your shooting hand
                and holster hip riddled with cancer. Anyone hit by a
                dirty bullet suffers 1 rad (page 77) in addition to
                normal damage. Carrying a weapon loaded with dirty
                bullets gives you 1 rad per shift.</p>

        <p>Designed for aiding in emergency

            ASSO-400 fires a grappling-hook￾tipped harpoon that carries a tether.
            The ASSO-400 is used to close
            the distance between free-floating
            objects and personnel in space.</p>

        <p>
        <h3>Harpoon Effect:</h3> On a hit, the grappling hook attaches to the target.
        In zero-G, if the target is heavier than you, you can use the tether to
        rappel quickly toward the target (full action, moves you to Adjacent range).
        If you are heavier, you can instead pull the target toward you (requires a
        STRENGTH roll if the target resists)</p>

            The weapon has a plasma charge build-up

        <p class="alien-indent-paragraph">The UA 571-C utilizes an M30

        <p>This 30 mm pump-action is typically

            but individual units do exist. When
            facing superior numbers, the U1 is
            your friend – don’t enter an alien hive

            with one, either. Just stay away from
            the hive. Okay?</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Standard payload for the U1 is
            M40 High Explosive fragmentation

            To use these U1 rounds as a thrown
            explosive, the red plastic cap must
            be removed and the trigger under it
            depressed. Three seconds later, the

        <p>These grenades are called “elec￾tronic ballbreakers” with good rea￾son. When deployed, they propel
            themselves about a meter off the
            ground before releasing a me￾ga-voltage electric pulse. The usu￾ally non-lethal shock is still strong
            enough to freeze a person’s central
            nervous system.</p>
        <p class="alien-indent-paragraph">These weapons are good for

        <p>This EVA hardsuit has fully￾articulated rotary joints and self￾actuating fingers, offering a limited
            range of mobility, but the maximum
            amount of protection from the
            hazards of space. The helmet has a
            sophisticated heads-up display built
            in, and the suit has its own thrusters
            for tether-free zero-G maneuvers.
            The comm array on a standard Eco
            EVA Suit is unshielded, and thus

        <p>Most starships, space stations,
            and military facilities are run via a
            sophisticated computer system
            called MU/TH/UR. Originally
            developed by Weyland Corporation
            at the end of the 21st century, the
            MU/TH/UR system soon became
            the standard for running complex
            automated systems and facilities.</p>
        <p class="alien-indent-paragraph">Affectionately nicknamed “Mother”
            by the crews who utilize these
            computers, over the decades various
            models have sported different levels
            of AI packages. While both the MU/
            TH/UR 1000 and 9000 series are
            sophisticated interactive models that
            over time can develop rudimentary
            personalities, most military, cargo,
            and utilitarian craft of today are
            equipped with the standard 5000

        <h2>Data Storage</h2>
        <p><strong>ALONG WITH A GUM WRAPPER</strong> and a
            few dirty tissues, people always need
            to carry information in their pocket.
            In the 22nd century, that is usually
            accomplished in the following ways.</p>

        <h3>Long-Data Discs</h3>
        <ul class="alien-chevron-list">
            <li><strong>Weight</strong> –</li>
            <li><strong>Cost</strong> $2,000</li>
            <li><strong>Effect</strong> Holds up to 10 zetta￾bytes (ZB) of data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After several data losses from
            electromagnetic pulses in the first
            half of the 21st century, the move was
            made to reintroduce and reinforce
            physical data storage. Weyland
            Corp scientists took optical disc
            media and enhanced it to the next
            level. The result is a nano-optical
            long-data memory disc. All colony
            and corporate records are backed
            up on these discs in case of an
            electromagnetic discharge.</p>

        <h3>Magnetic Tape</h3>
        <ul class="alien-chevron-list">
            <li><strong>Weight</strong> –</li>
            <li><strong>Cost</strong> $5</li>
            <li><strong>Effect</strong> Holds up to 120 tera￾bytes (TB) of data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A two-hundred-year-old technology,
            magnetic tape cassettes have
            become popular on the Frontier simply
            because they are both disposable and
            cheap. Utilizing sputter deposition
            technology, these cassettes can hold
            between 60, 90, or 120 terabytes (TB)
            of information each.</p>
        <p class="alien-indent-paragraph">While easily disrupted by a strong
            magnetic pulse, the benefit of
            magnetic tapes is that the archaic
            technology that runs them produces
            no easily detected wave signals.
            Most security sensor grids are set to
            detect more sophisticated electronic
            hardware. All these factors combined
            have managed to keep magnetic
            tapes in vogue for the past fifty years.</p>

        <h2>Diagnostics & Display</h2>
        <h3>Computer Terminal</h3>
        <ul class="alien-chevron-list">

                data (COMTECH roll).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A computer terminal is any colony,
            starship, or station based electronic
            hardware that can access and
            process data via keyboard or voice
            commands and monitor, or hologram.
            Using the right codes and <span class="alien-code">COMTECH</span>
            rolls at a terminal can potentially give
            you access to whatever MU/TH/UR
            or A.P.O.L.L.O. knows.</p>

        <p>A dual-faced precision wristwatch,
            each Samani E-series device is
            capable of telling the time and
            date for two synchronized colonial
            locations, allowing space travelers to
            keep track of time back home while
            they are in deep space. The latest
            addition, the E-550, includes oxygen
            and pressure sensors to warn its
            user of a hull breach.</p>

                vitals (<span class="alien-code">MEDICAL AID</span> +1).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These "PDTs" transmit the recipient’s
            location. Some models also monitor
            vital signs. Most corporate sponsored
            Frontier worlds equip their colonists
            with PDTs in order to keep track of
            them in hostile environments. PDTs
            can be surgically implanted, built
            into a pressure suit, or worn as an
            accessory.</p>

        <h3>IFF Transponder</h3>
        <ul class="alien-chevron-list">
            <li><strong>Weight</strong> –</li>

        <p>A personal beacon that prevents
            automated sentry systems from
            accidentally blowing friendly targets
            to pieces. Usually surgically implanted
            before a campaign, the only flaws
            in the system are when their signal
            is disrupted and when an enemy
            gets their hands on a transceiver
            for infiltration purposes. How is this
            accomplished if IFFs are surgically
            implanted? You’d be amazed what a
            good sharp knife can do.</p>

            the built-in visual and audio recorders
            on a space suit helmet. They wire￾lessly transmit data to the terminal
            they are synced to. Information cap￾tured by the device can be analyzed
            by a MU/TH/UR or A.P.O.L.L.O. sys￾tem or displayed on a HoloTab.</p>

        <p>A motion-scanning device, the M314
            uses high-powered ultrasonic waves
            to detect movement within its sensor
            range. Originally designed for rescue
            teams searching for civilians, the
            tracker soon found use by the military
            fighting guerrilla forces in extrasolar
            environments.</p>

        </ul>
        <p>The drawback to the M314 is its size
            and weight. An experimental pulse
            rifle mounted upgrade, the M316,
            is currently being field tested. It is
            compact, lightweight and easy to
            glance at in a firefight. While the M316
            operates about the same as the M314,
            it has a much more limited range. Your
            results may vary, but that’s what you

            subject in stasis. A skilled user can
            also use a neurovisor to communicate
            with a hyper sleeping subject, and
            an advanced user can use one to
            manipulate one’s dreams. So the next
            time you go into hypersleep, keep

        <p>Sometimes called “Pups,” these

            across, and over otherwise difficult
            to navigate terrain.</p>
        <p class="alien-indent-paragraph">As these orbs scout about, they
            constantly scan a 360-degree area
            around the device with mapping
            lasers. The Pups then send the
            spectrograph information back to
            a synced device, usually a starship
            or ground-based HoloTab or a mon￾itoring station in a mobile command
            vehicle. They can also detect life￾forms, atmospheric conditions, toxins, and more.</p>
        <p class="alien-indent-paragraph">Pups were given their nickname

        <ul class="alien-chevron-list">
            <li><strong>Weight</strong> ½</li>
            <li><strong>Cost</strong> $2– $100</li>
            <li><strong>Effect</strong> Satisfies water needs
                for one day.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Shipboard company supplied water
            ($2) is rationed, cloudy, recycled, and
            tastes metallic, but gets you through
            the day. Bottles of purified water ($10)
            are luxury items on some worlds, and
            can fetch as much as $100/bottle on
            a barren rock.</p>

        <h3>Coffee</h3>
        <ul class="alien-chevron-list">
            <li><strong>Weight</strong> –</li>
            <li><strong>Cost</strong> Free–$1.50</li>
            <li><strong>Effect</strong> Stress level +1 and
                postpones fatigue from lack of sleep
                for one shift. Additional doses in the
                same shift have no effect</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Coffee is supplied on most company
            ships and stations free of charge for
            the crew. Grown in Guatemala on
            Earth, Weyland-Yutani coffee is the
            highest rated in the territories, and
            free coffee is considered one of the
            perks of W-Y employment. If you are
            on the verge of dozing off, coffee can
            give you a caffeine boost to get you
            through the morning.</p>

        <h3>"Bug Juice" Protein Drink</h3>
        <ul class="alien-chevron-list">
            <li><strong>Weight</strong> ½</li>
            <li><strong>Cost</strong> $5</li>
            <li><strong>Effect</strong> Satisfies food and water
                needs for one day.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Commonly referred to as “bug juice,”
            this high protein caloric drink is made
            from mealworms, roaches, beetles,
            and other insects all raised on bug
            farms. Made by a large variety of
            manufacturers, it is a cheap and cost￾effective way of keeping alive on the
            Frontier.</p>

        <h3>Colony Speciality Meals</h3>
        <ul class="alien-chevron-list">
            <li><strong>Weight</strong> ½</li>
            <li><strong>Cost</strong> $20–$300</li>
            <li><strong>Effect</strong> Satisfies food needs
                for one day, stress
                level –1.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Planetside colony grub can be a
            better thing, as colonists get creative
            with their rations to create new
            “culinary delights.” Some colonies
            grow their own livestock while others
            have access to edible indigenous
            wildlife, creating a wide variety of
            cuisine ranging from Terraform 3’s
            bovine burgers and steaks to boiled
            Tanakan scorpion thorax to kelp
            salad and sushi from Bracken’s World.</p>

        <h3>Recreational Drugs</h3>
        <ul class="alien-chevron-list">
            <li><strong>Cost</strong> Varies from $5 for a
                pack of cigarettes to $60,000 for a
                kilo of benzoylecgonine.</li>
            <li><strong>Effect</strong> Typically stress level
                +1 or –1. Each dose beyond the first
                in the same shift gives −1 dice to all
                skill rolls until the end of the shift</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Get ‘recked. Cannabis,  tobacco,
            and certain doses of steroids,
            benzodiazepines and methylene￾dioxymethamphetamine are all legal
            drugs prescribed for recreational use
            by corporate physicians.</p>

        <h3>X-Drugs</h3>
        <ul class="alien-chevron-list">
            <li><strong>Cost</strong> Varies</li>
            <li><strong>Effect</strong> Varies</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These are the more extreme
            drugs out there that most ethical
            corporations work to keep off their
            colonies. These X-drugs increase
            strength, endurance, and the senses,
            but prolonged use can result in severe
            side effects such as hallucinations,
            seizures, psychosis, and stroke. The
            Colonial Marine Corps is rumored to
            be experimenting with new powerful
            X-Stims for its soldiers.</p>

        <h3>Beer and Booze</h3>
        <ul class="alien-chevron-list">
            <li><strong>Weight</strong> ½</li>
            <li><strong>Cost</strong> $5–$500</li>
            <li><strong>Effect</strong> Stress level –1. Each
                dose beyond the first in the same
                shift gives −1 dice to all skill rolls until
                the end of the shift.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Time to get your buzz on. Alcohol
            remains the old go to, with whiskey
            and vodka dominating the market.
            The beer of choice on the frontier
            is Weyland-Yutani’s original and
            genuine “extra strong” Aspen beer.
            It’s watered down and tastes like
            piss but it gets the job done – and it’s
            better than that Souta Dry crap.</p>

            to get around planetside on the Frontier. Just make sure
            you keep that trunk locked.</p>
