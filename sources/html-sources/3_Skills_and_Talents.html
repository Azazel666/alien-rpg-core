        <p><strong>ROLEPLAYING IS A CONVERSATION.</strong> The GM sets the
            scene, you describe what you do, she tells you how the
            NPCs react, you respond, and so on – back and forth. The
            story grows one step at a time, and everyone lives happily
            ever after.</p>
        <p>Yeah, just kidding about that last part. Not on the
            Frontier, you don’t.</p>
        <p>Sooner or later, the shit – just like prisoner Murphy –
            hits the fan. Things come to a head, a point of no return is
            reached, and a problem mounts that cannot just be settled
            by talking your way out of it.</p>
        <p>That’s when you call upon your mad skills. Just break
            out the dice and show Mother you know a thing or two.</p>

        <h1>USING SKILLS</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>THERE ARE TWELVE SKILLS</strong> in total in the game. Three
            skills are typically linked to each of the four attributes:
            Strength, Agility, Wits, and Empathy. Skills are measured
            in skill levels, from 0 to 5. You can increase your skill levels
            during play (page 30).
        </p>
        <h2>Dice</h2>
        <p>Two types of six-sided dice are used in this game: base
            dice and stress dice. You can use any normal six-sided dice
            if you don’t have access to the custom dice for the game,
            but it helps if you have them in two different colors to tell
            base dice and stress dice apart.</p>
        <h2>When To Roll</h2>
        <p>Generally, the rules in this book or the adventure text will
            indicate when to roll dice and what skill to roll for. However,
            the GM can always call for a roll in a situation she feels
            warrants it. We recommend against excessive dice rolling
            however, saving the rolls for dramatic and tense situations
            where something is truly at stake.</p>
        <h2><span class="alien-dice-success"></span> Means Success</h2>
        <p>To use a skill, add your skill level to your score in the
            attribute linked to the skill, and grab that many base dice.
            Then roll all the dice together. For your action to succeed,
            you must roll at least one 6 (<span class="alien-dice-success"></span> on the custom dice) – if
            not, your action fails.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Stress Dice:</h3> If you have stress level 1 or higher, add this
        number of stress dice to the dice pool as well. If you roll a
        1 on one or more stress dice (<span class="alien-dice-stress-failure"></span> on the custom dice), you
        suffer a stress response – see page 44.</p>
        </p>

        <div class="alien-info-box-top-border">
            <div class="alien-info-box-title">NPCS & Skills</div>
            <p>Non-player characters use skills in the same way
                as player characters, with the one major difference
                being that NPCs never push rolls. This means
                NPCs don’t have a stress level.</p>
            <p>
                The GM rolls dice for NPCs, but should only roll
                for actions that affect a PC directly – for example,
                if the NPC is attacking a player character or is
                attempting to save them. When an NPC performs an
                action that does not directly affect a PC, the GM can
                simply decide what happens, without rolling dice.</p>

            <div class="alien-info-box-title">Switching Attributes</div>
            <p>If the GM or adventure text calls for it, you may
                need to use a different attribute than the one
                normally linked to a skill. For example, threatening
                an NPC may use <span class="alien-code">Strength</span> + <span class="alien-code">MANIPULATION</span>
                instead
                of <span class="alien-code">Empathy</span> + <span class="alien-code">MANIPULATION</span>. You can even
                suggest
                rolling for a different attribute yourself if the
                situation calls for it. The GM has final say. Note that
                some talents specifically allow a different attribute
                to be used with a certain skill.</p>
        </div>

        <p>
        <h3>Rolls Without Skill:</h3> If you don’t have the skill required
        for the particular action you want to perform, you can roll
        anyway – simply roll a number of base dice equal to your
        attribute as well as any stress dice.</p>
        <h2>Modifiers</h2>
        <p>The rules or the GM can modify your chances, adding or
            removing base dice for you to roll. This is referred to as
            +1 die, +2 dice, etc., and conversely –1 die, –2 dice, etc. You
            can never go below one base die. Modifiers never affect
            stress dice.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Gear:</h3> Equipment can modify your roll, but not always.
        Sometimes a specific item is needed just to perform the
        action. Weapons and other types of gear are found in
        chapter 5.</p>
        <h2>Helping</h2>
        <p>Up to three other PCs and NPCs can help you with a dice
            roll. Each person helping you gives you +1 die, but they
            need to be in a position to actually support your action in
            a concrete way. The GM has final say. In combat, helping
            someone uses up your full action for the round.</p>

                <p>The air scrubbers on the USCSS Miranda are offline and our
                    roughneck Nat tries to repair them. With <span class="alien-code">Strength</span> 5 and skill level
                    3
                    in <span class="alien-code">HEAVY MACHINERY</span>, she gets eight base Dices. She uses a
                    maintenance jack
                    for the job and Jeffries helps her out, giving her +2 Dice for a whopping
                    total of ten base dice.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Multiple Successes</h2>
        <p>The more <span class="alien-dice-success"></span> you roll, the better the result. In combat (page
            59), that usually means more damage, but it can mean
            any number of bonus effects – for example:</p>
        <ul class="alien-chevron-list">
            <li>You show off.</li>
            <li>You do it quickly.</li>
            <li>You do it quietly.</li>
            <li>You achieve some unexpected additional effect.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The adventure text or the GM has final say on what extra
            <span class="alien-dice-success"></span> can be used for.
        </p>
        <h2>Failure</h2>
        <p>If you don’t roll any <span class="alien-dice-success"></span>, you mess up. For some reason,
            you failed to achieve your goal. Feel free to elaborate on
            why with the help of the GM. She might even decide that
            a failed roll has further consequences that will move the
            story forward in a dramatic way.</p>
        <p>Failure should never stop the story completely. Even when
            you fail, there must be a way forward – perhaps at the cost of
            time, risk, or W-Y dollars, but still a way. The GM has the final
            say on the consequences of failure in any particular situation.</p>
        <p>You have one last chance if you really want to succeed
            – you can push the roll.</p>
        <h2>Pushing Your Roll</h2>
        <p>If you fail a roll, or need more <span class="alien-dice-success"></span>, you can choose to push
            the roll. This immediately increases your stress level (page
            72) one step, meaning you add one stress die to your
            dice pool. Then re-roll all dice not showing <span class="alien-dice-success"></span>. All dice count
            after the re-roll, including the ones not re-rolled.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Stress Dice:</h3> If you rolled one or more on stress dice
        in the initial roll, you cannot push the roll.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Just Once:</h3> You can only push your roll once, unless you
        have a talent that allows you to push a roll a second time.</p>

        <div class="alien-info-box-top-border">
            <div class="alien-info-box-title">Pushing Your Roll</div>
            <p>Despite good odds, Nat fails to repair the air scrubbers.
                She decides to push the roll, increasing her stress level to 1
                and adding one stress die to her dice pool. She then re-rolls the
                ten base dice along with the stress die, now getting two <span class="alien-dice-success"></span>. She
                succeeds,
                and as a bounus effect for the extra <span class="alien-dice-success"></span>, the GM decides tat she
                finds
                a strange icky trail leading into the air shafts...</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Stress Response</h2>
        <p>If you roll <span class="alien-dice-stress-failure"></span> on one or more stress dice in a skill roll, a
            stress response is triggered. Roll a D6, adding your stress
            level and subtracting your Resolve score (page 26)
            before comparing the result to the table below. Your stress
            responses are removed by relieving stress (page 73).
            If you get a stress response that you already have, you
            instead gain stress level +1.</p>
        <h2>Passive Rolls</h2>
        <p>Sometimes, the GM will ask you to roll for something you’re
            not even aware of – typically <span class="alien-code">OBSERVATION</span> rolls in stealth
            mode (page 56). Such rolls cannot be pushed, nor trigger
            stress responses. You still add your stress level to the roll.
            The GM can even make some passive rolls in secret.</p>

        <h2>Opposed Rolls</h2>
        <p>When facing an active resistance to your skill roll, you need
            to roll off against your opponent. In an opposed roll, you need
            to roll more <span class="alien-dice-success"></span> than your opponent to succeed. You can push
            the roll even if you’re the target of an opposed roll. Opposed
            rolls are used sparingly, only when indicated by the rules or
            the adventure text, or when deemed appropriate by the GM.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>PvP:</h3> In the case of two PCs rolling off against each other,
        the active PC decides whether to push the roll first, and if so,
        re-rolls, then the passive PC decides whether to push or not.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Open Rolls:</h3> In opposed rolls where there is no clear active
        party, a tie means there is no clear winner of the roll. If this
        doesn’t work in the situation, break the tie randomly.</p>

                    bypass Mother's antagonistic actions by accessing her
                    core in the mainframe. The GM says this is an opposed
                    roll against Mother's <span class="alien-code">COMTECH</span> skill level of 7 (the ship's
                    MU/TH/UR 7000 mainframe has no base attributes).
                    Charlize has no <span class="alien-code">COMTECH</span> skill, so she's just Rolling
                    four base Dice for her <span class="alien-code">Wits</span> and four stress Dice for
                    the current stress level. Her roll comes up with one <span class="alien-dice-success"></span>,
                    but the GM rolls for Mother and get two <span class="alien-dice-success"></span>.</p>
                <p class="alien-indent-paragraph">Charlize decides to push the roll, increasing her
                    stress level to 5 and adding Another stress die to her

                    two more <span class="alien-dice-success"></span> for a total of three! However, she also
                    rolls one <span class="alien-dice-stress-failure"></span> on a stress die. With a <span

                    and stress level 5, she rolls a D6 and adds 1. In a stroke
                    of bad luck, she rolls a 6 for a total of 7. The captain
                    messes up! On the brink of triumph, Mother takes
                    control of the USCSS Miranda and her Communications.

        <h1>THE SKILLS</h1>
        <h2>Heavy Machinery <sub>(Strength)</sub></h2>
        <p>Hard work is part of life for any roughneck on the Frontier,
            but at least you have powerful machines to help you. Roll
            for this skill when you attempt to use, repair, jury-rig or
            break any kind of heavy machinery.</p>
        <h2>Stamina <sub>(Strength)</sub></h2>
        <p>When your physical endurance or vigor is tested, roll for
            <span class="alien-code">STAMINA</span>. For example, this skill is used to survive the cold
            vacuum of space or to resist a deadly contagion.
        </p>
        <h2>Close Combat <sub>(Strength)</sub></h2>
        <p>The world of ALIEN is a brutal place. Sometimes, you have
            no choice but to fight for your life, up close and personal.
            Roll for this skill when you attack someone in close combat.
            Read more about close combat in chapter 4.</p>
        <h2>Mobility <sub>(Agility)</sub></h2>
        <p>Roll for <span class="alien-code">MOBILITY</span> to perform any kind of acrobatic
            movement such as a risky climb or a dangerous jump.</p>
        <h2>Piloting <sub>(Agility)</sub></h2>
        <p>Be it a dropship, a star freighter or a battle frigate, you’re
            the one to fly it. Roll for <span class="alien-code">PILOTING</span> when you attempt any
            difficult and dangerous maneuver at the helm of any type
            of spacecraft (page 143). The skill can also be used to
            drive ground vehicles.</p>
        <h2>Ranged Combat <sub>(Agility)</sub></h2>
        <p>If you have a ranged weapon, you can take down your
            enemy from a distance without getting your hands
            bloody. Use the <span class="alien-code">RANGED COMBAT</span> skill to fire all types
            of ranged weapons. Read more about ranged combat
            in chapter 4.</p>
        <h2>Comtech <sub>(Wits)</sub></h2>
        <p>Programming androids, mainframes, and other types of
            advanced technology requires specialist knowledge. Roll
            for <span class="alien-code">COMTECH</span> for any challenging attempt to program, repair,
            decrypt or otherwise manipulate any type of computer or
            communications technology.</p>
        <h2>Observation <sub>(Wits)</sub></h2>
        <p>In the world of ALIEN, you need to be on your guard at
            all times, or you won’t live long. Use your <span class="alien-code">OBSERVATION</span>
            skill to spot someone sneaking. You can also use the
            skill when you spot an unknown threat of some kind, to
            learn more about it. Read more about stealth mode in
            the next chapter.</p>
        <h2>Survival <sub>(Wits)</sub></h2>
        <p>Terraforming can make the atmosphere on alien worlds
            (passably) breathable, but it will rarely make them Earthlike.
            You might be able to breathe without a pressure suit on
            such worlds, though you can also expect to struggle
            against extreme heat and cold, sandstorms, acid rain, and
            other extreme weather. Roll for <span class="alien-code">SURVIVAL</span> when you’re in
            a hazardous environment to avoid becoming fatigued – or
            worse (page 75).</p>
        <h2>Command <sub>(Empathy)</sub></h2>
        <p>If you are to survive the horrors of space, you’ll need a
            good leader – or you must become one yourself. You can
            use your <span class="alien-code">COMMAND</span> skill to stop panic in other PCs (page
            72) and to give orders in combat (page 60).</p>
        <h2>Manipulation <sub>(Empathy)</sub></h2>
        <p>Alien life forms may gut you without remorse, but the most
            truly dangerous beings in the ALIEN universe are corporate
            agents and other schemers who use lies, threats, or subtle
            persuasion to get what they want. To make another person
            see things your way, roll for <span class="alien-code">MANIPULATION</span>. If the person is
            actively opposed to your point of view, this is an opposed
            <span class="alien-code">MANIPULATION</span> roll (page 44). Your chances are affected
            by your negotiating position (see the adjacent sidebar).
        </p>

        <div class="alien-info-box-top-border">
            <div class="alien-info-box-title">Not Mind Control</div>
            <p>When you use <span class="alien-code">MANIPULATION</span> on someone, you
                don’t take control of their mind. What you are trying
                to convince your adversary to do must be somewhat
                reasonable, or the GM can disallow it.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Medical Aid <sub>(Empathy)</sub></h2>
        <p>In the world of ALIEN, there is a significant risk that you
            or the other characters will be injured, sooner or later. Roll
            for <span class="alien-code">MEDICAL AID</span> to give first aid to a dying character (page
            68) or to make medical examinations.</p>

            <div class="alien-info-box-tab-header">negotiating Position</div>
            <p>Your chances of using <span class="alien-code">MANIPULATION</span> on someone
                successfully are affected by your negotiating
                position.</p>
            <p><strong>Each of the following factors gives you +1 die:</strong></p>
            <ul class="alien-chevron-list">
                <li>You have more people on your side.</li>

                <li>Your opponent has suffered damage.</li>
                <li>You have helped your opponent previously.</li>
                <li>You present your case very well (determined by the GM).</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Each of the following factors gives you −1 die:</strong></p>

                <li>Your opponent has nothing to gain by helping you.</li>
                <li>You are having trouble understanding each other.</li>
                <li>You are talking via radio or shouting at a distance.</li>

        <h1>TALENTS</h1>
        <p><strong>TO SURVIVE AND THRIVE</strong> in the cold dark of space you
            need to find your own niche, something you and no one else
            can do. Such special abilities are called talents.</p>
        <p>Talents can affect how you use skills or how you recover
            from damage or stress, or even let you do things that are
            quite simply impossible for others. Unlike skills, talents are
            not rated – you either have them or you don’t.</p>
        <p>There are two distinct types of talents – career talents
            and general talents. Career talents can only be learned by
            characters with a specific career. General talents can be
            learned by anyone. You can learn new talents during play
            (page 30).</p>

        <ul class="alien-chevron-list">
            <li>
                <h3>Banter:</h3> The stress level of you and everyone in Short
                range drops two steps (instead of one) for every stretch
                of time spent in a safe place (page 73).
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Overkill:</h3> When you roll 9 or higher on a panic roll (page
                72), you can ignore the result and instead go into
                overkill. All other PCs in the same zone must make an
                immediate panic roll. While in overkill, you must attack
                your enemies on every turn and you cannot take cover,
                dodge, or defend yourself against attacks. The effect
                stops when you or all enemies in sight are broken.

                stress level to produce an item of your choice – you had

                <h3>Resilient:</h3> Roll for <span class="alien-code">Strength</span> (attribute only) any time
                you suffer damage. You can’t push the roll, which does
                not count as an action. For every <span class="alien-dice-success"></span> you roll, one point
                of damage is eliminated.
            </li>
            <li>

                into alien artifacts or creatures that you examine for
                at least one stretch. For every <span class="alien-dice-success"></span> you roll, you may
                ask the GM one of the following questions: Is it human
                or alien? Is it dead or alive? How old is it? What is its
                purpose? How does it work? What problems could it
                cause? The GM must answer truthfully, but is allowed
                to give vague or incomplete answers. A successful
                roll reduces the stress level of all other PCs within
                Short range 1 step, while a failed roll increases their
                stress levels by 1. Only one attempt is allowed per
                examined object.

                creature of any kind, you may make an <span class="alien-code">OBSERVATION</span>
                roll (quick action). If successful, you realize a potential
                weakness of the creature, if it has any. If you fail, gain
                stress level +1. Only one attempt per Xenomorph is
                allowed.
