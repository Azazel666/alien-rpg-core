        <p><strong>FIGHT OR FLIGHT?</strong> That’s the big question, now, isn’t it?
            You may feel invincible tucked away behind your cozy
            character sheet, but your PC is out there on the line – and
            they are damn well mortal. Remember back in chapter 2
            when we told you not to get your character killed? Consider
            this your second warning.</p>
        <p>Often, it’s a better bet to run away and fight another day
            – assuming you’re fast enough to escape whatever thing is
            nipping at your heels. Often, it’s best to just meld into the
            shadows and be all quiet-like. Before releasing the safety
            on your pulse rifle, always ask yourself – is it worth it?</p>
        <p>Sometimes you have no choice. Sometimes that alien
            thing you thought was right behind you is already waiting
            for you in that dark corner you thought was safe.</p>
        <p>Just coming face-to-face with an alien monstrosity can
            turn your mind to jelly. You may only have a split second
            before the beast dismembers you and crushes your skull.
            And alien species aren’t the only danger.</p>
        <p>People on the Frontier are jerks. Sometimes, someone
            just sticks a gun in your face. When backed against a wall,
            you damn well better fight. When someone or something
            comes for you, you need to be able to defend yourself.</p>
        <p>Here’s how.</p>

        <h2>Maps</h2>
        <p>A stealth scene or a fight in the ALIEN roleplaying game
            is typically played out using a map of the starship, colony,
            or whatever location your characters happen to find
            themselves fighting for their lives in.</p>
        <p>Large, full-color maps of adventure locations are
            included in the Hope’s Last Day Starter Set and cinematic
            adventures such as Rapture Protocol, but maps with less
            detail work as well, even quickly hand-drawn sketches by
            the GM are fine for more improvised play.</p>

        <div class="alien-info-box-inverted">
            <div class="alien-info-box-title">Using Miniatures</div>
            <p>For an even more visceral and tangible game
                experience, official miniatures for the ALIEN roleplaying
                game are available separately. Together
                with the large, full-color maps included in the
                Hope’s Last Day Starter Set and the Rapture
                Protocol cinematic adventure, the miniatures can
                even be used to play skirmish-style wargames.
                Rules for that are available in the miniatures set.</p>
        </div>

        <p>
        <h3>Tokens & Miniatures:</h3> To track movement on the map
        during stealth or combat, you can use the cardboard tokens
        in official ALIEN RPG releases like the Hope’s Last Day
        Starter Set, miniatures such as those included in the ALIEN
        RPG Miniatures Set, digital tokens on your virtual tabletop,
        or anything else that works for your table.</p>
        <h2>Zones</h2>
        <p>The map is divided into zones. A zone is typically a room,
            a corridor, or an area of ground. How big a zone is varies –
            from a few steps across up to about 25 meters. A zone is
            generally smaller in a cramped environment than in open
            terrain. In official adventures, zone borders are indicated
            on the location maps.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Cluttered/ Open:</h3> A zone is either cluttered,
        meaning there are objects in the zone to hide or take
        cover in or behind, or open, meaning there are no such
        objects in the zone. Open zones are typically corridors and
        crawlspaces, but can also be empty rooms or other open
        spaces. If the adventure text does not indicate whether a
        zone is open or cluttered, the GM makes a judgment call.</p>

        <p>
        <h3>Borders:</h3> A border between two adjacent zones is either
        open or blocked (by a wall or bulkhead). A blocked border
        can have a door or a hatch, as indicated by the map,
        allowing movement between the two zones. Corridors
        and crawlspaces are divided into several zones by doors
        or lines on the map.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Line Of Sight:</h3> Except for characters who are hiding or
        in full cover, everyone in the same zone has line of sight to
        each other. This does not apply to narrow crawlspaces like
        air shafts – there, other characters block line of sight (even
        friendlies). Open zone borders don’t block line of sight.
        A blocked border generally blocks line of sight even if there
        is a door or hatch in it – unless you’re actively standing by
        the doorway and peeking through.</p>

            <div class="alien-info-box-title">Playing Without Maps</div>
            <p>Although maps can be useful, you can choose not
                to use them and let certain conflicts play out only
                in the “theater of the mind.” In this case, the GM
                needs to determine lines of sight and the distances
                between combatants.</p>

        <h2>Range</h2>
        <p>The distance between combatants is divided into five range
            categories. See the diagram above.</p>
        <h2>Measuring Time</h2>
        <p>In the ALIEN universe, time matters. Whether you are
            awaiting rescue on an alien world with Xenomorphs
            stalking you, or Mother is counting down to the imminent
            destruction of your ship, you need to keep track of time.</p>
        <p>Three separate units of time are typically used in the
            game, depending on the situation at hand. See the table
            below. The exact duration of a round, stretch and shift can
            vary depending on the situation.</p>

        <table class="alien-table">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Unit</th>
                    <th>Duration</th>

            <p>During a countdown to some catastrophic event,
                time can be treated as a consumable (page 28).
                The GM or the adventure text sets the timer to
                a certain number of minutes. After each combat
                round, a supply roll is made. For each <span class="alien-dice-stress-failure"></span> rolled, the
                number of minutes remaining is reduced by one.</p>

        <h1>Stealth Mode</h1>
        <div class="alien-h1-quote">
            "If you don't stay quiet, we all die."
        </div>
        <div class="alien-h1-quote-author">Andy</div>

        <p><strong>IN THE ALIEN ROLEPLAYING GAME</strong>, much of the thrill
            happens before the enemy shows itself and bullets start
            flying. A key part of the experience is exploring unknown
            locations, with enemies lurking in the darkness. In the game,
            this is represented by what we call stealth mode. Stealth
            mode is played out in stretches of time, each approximately
            5–10 minutes long.</p>
        <h2>PC Movement</h2>
        <p>Movement in stealth mode is slow and careful. In one
            stretch of time, your character can move into an adjacent
            zone on the map (assuming the border is open or has an
            open door or hatch), scan for enemies, and get a superficial
            description of the zone from the GM. If you’re a team, you
            can move individually or as a group. The order in which PCs
            move is chosen freely.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Searching A Zone:</h3> If you want to examine something
        in a zone more closely, to search a room or access a data
        terminal, you may need to stay several stretches in the
        zone (or even a full shift), if the adventure text or the GM
        calls for it.</p>
        <h2>NPC Movement</h2>
        <p>In stealth mode, NPC movement is managed secretly by
            the GM each stretch, after your PCs have moved. Human
            NPCs follow the same rules for movement as PCs, while
            Xenomorphs may move one zone per point of Speed (page
            208) each stretch. The order of NPC movement is chosen
            by the GM.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Active & Passive:</h3> An adventure text may tell the GM
        that enemies are active or passive. Active enemies are
        moving across the map, stalking you or trying to hide
        from you. Passive enemies are not aware of you and
        are most often stationary, until they spot you or are
        otherwise alerted to your presence. Enemies may switch
        from passive to active, or vice versa, as dictated by the
        adventure or the GM.</p>

        <p>
        <h3>Hidden Map:</h3> To manage NPC movement, we recommend
        that the GM has a second copy of the map, hidden from
        view by the GM Screen. On this map, the GM can place
        tokens to represent NPCs, hidden from the players’
        view. GM maps for this purpose are included in official
        adventures. If the GM doesn’t have access to a screen,
        they can track hidden NPC movement on a piece of paper</p>

            <p>Managing NPC movement secretly by the GM in
                stealth mode is a great way to create real tension
                at the table, a true game of cat and mouse – or
                rather, a game of human and terrifying Xenomorph! However, it does require some table space
                (or virtual tabletop support) and might not always
                be feasible. In such cases, the system can be
                simplified to only have the PCs move according to
                the stealth mode rules, while NPCs (and motion
                tracker pings) simply appear when and where the
                GM so chooses.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Crawlspaces</h2>
        <p>Air shafts and other crawlspaces are a common feature
            in ALIEN adventures and present a unique challenge in
            stealth mode. Crawlspaces can run by the side of rooms
            and corridors, above them or underneath them (in which
            case just the outline is shown on official adventure maps).</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Access Points:</h3> A crawlspace can be entered by one
        zone’s worth of movement at any access point marked on
        the map, just like entering any other zone.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Sealing Access Points:</h3> An access point can typically
        be sealed shut with a cutting torch by making a <span class="alien-code">HEAVY
            MACHINERY</span> roll (full action, one attempt per stretch is
        allowed). Not even Xenomorphs can break through a
        sealed access point, but acid blood will burn through a
        crawlspace floor in one stretch (if there is gravity), creating
        a new access point if the duct is above a room.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Open Zones:</h3> Zones in crawlspaces are generally
        considered open, meaning it’s not possible to hide there
        (or take cover in combat, see page 66).</p>
        <h2>Detection</h2>
        <p>When you come within line of sight of an NPC in stealth
            mode, or vice versa, make a passive open opposed
            <span class="alien-code">OBSERVATION</span> roll. This means the roll cannot be pushed,
            nor trigger stress responses (page 44). The GM will
            just ask you to roll <span class="alien-code">OBSERVATION</span> without telling you why,
            and roll for the NPC.
        </p>
        <p>If one side wins the roll, they spot the other first and can
            choose to declare their presence, ambush their opponent
            (page 59), hide in the zone (next page), or back out of
            the zone the same way they entered. Backing out of the
            zone in this situation is done immediately and does not
            count toward the normal movement in this stretch.</p>
        <p>On a tied roll, you spot each other at the same time –
            draw initiative (page 59).
        </p>
        <p>
        <h3>Keeping Guard:</h3> If a person remains stationary in a zone
        for a stretch and does nothing except keeping guard, they
        gain +2 dice to <span class="alien-code">OBSERVATION</span> rolls to spot anything coming
        within line of sight.</p>

        <h2>Groups In Stealth Mode</h2>
        <p>When several characters moving as a group come into
            line of sight of another character (or group), all characters
            in each group get to roll <span class="alien-code">OBSERVATION</span>. Only the best
            roll on each side counts. For a group of NPCs with
            identical stats, the GM will typically make just a single
            <span class="alien-code">OBSERVATION</span> roll and apply the result to the whole group,
            to keep things simple.
        </p>
        <h2>Hiding</h2>
        <p>A character can hide in a cluttered zone (but not in an
            open zone). To hide carefully takes one stretch, and thus
            cannot be combined with movement or searching the zone
            – except immediately after a (won) <span class="alien-code">OBSERVATION</span> roll when
            coming within line of sight of an enemy (see Detection,
            above). In this specific case only, hiding is “free.” Items can
            also be hidden in a zone.</p>

        <p>
        <h3>Finding What’s Hidden:</h3> When an enemy enters a zone
        with a hidden character, no opposed <span class="alien-code">OBSERVATION</span> roll is
        made. Instead, the enemy must actively search the zone
        for a stretch and make an <span class="alien-code">OBSERVATION</span> roll. If the roll fails,
        another roll can be made each stretch. Typically, an NPC
        will only search a zone for one stretch before moving on.
        If a hidden character is found, draw initiative.</p>

        <p>
        <h3>Multiple Searchers:</h3> If several characters search a zone
        at the same time, they can make separate rolls or let one
        character roll, and the others help (page 43).</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Multiple Hidden Things:</h3> If there are several hidden
        characters and/or items in a zone, each <span class="alien-dice-success"></span> rolled on the
        <span class="alien-code">OBSERVATION</span> roll(s) will reveal one of them. The order in
        which they are found is up to the GM.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Taking Action:</h3> A hidden character may, at their turn in
        the stretch, take action to move out of the zone, interact
        with something in the zone, or ambush an enemy. In all
        such cases, make an opposed <span class="alien-code">OBSERVATION</span> roll against
        all enemies in line of sight.</p>

        <div class="alien-info-box-top-border">
            <div class="alien-info-box-title">Darkness</div>
            <p>In dark zones with very dim lightning, <span class="alien-code">OBSERVATION</span>
                rolls for humans (and androids) are made with –2
                dice. Xenomorphs are not affected. A flashlight will
                remove the effects of darkness in a zone.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Motion Trackers</h2>
        <p>A motion tracker, such as the M314 unit (page 96),
            can be used once per stretch. This does not exclude
            other activities during the stretch, but before the tracker
            gives any information a power supply roll must be made
            (page 29).</p>
        <p>If still powered up, the motion tracker will automatically
            detect the presence of all NPCs within its range (four zones
            for an M314), even if not within line of sight – but only NPCs
            who moved in the previous stretch. NPCs who remained
            stationary in the previous stretch are not detected.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Tracker Pings:</h3> Mark the “pings” of movement from a
        motion tracker by placing tokens on the map. Such tokens
        are included in the Hope’s Last Day Starter Set. Detecting
        an NPC with a motion tracker does not mean that the PC
        has spotted it – it only means the players get an indication
        of where an NPC is present.</p>

                <p>Nat and Hayes are checking out the abnormal engine readings on the USCSS Miranda while carefully
                    looking for the unknown killer on board, moving zone by zone in stealth mode.
                    The GM moves the killer on her hidden GM map.
                    It is currently stationary in the engine control room.</p>
                <p>After a few stretches, Nat and Hayes split up as the medic wants to look for a surgical kit.
                    On her turn, Nat moves very carefully into the engine control room, where a horrifying Xenomorph
                    lurks. A passive opposed <span class="alien-code">OBSERVATION</span> roll is made and Nat wins!
                    She takes a chance and decides to hide in the zone, under a control console.</p>
                <p>Now, as Nat is hidden and the Xenomorph is not actively looking for her, it does not get to roll
                    <span class="alien-code">OBSERVATION</span> again until Nat moves out of hiding.
                    The GM decides that the Xenomorph moves on its next turn, quickly jumping into an air shaft.
                    Nat is free to come out of hiding to check the engine controls.
                </p>

        <h2>Starting A Fight</h2>
        <p>When a PC spots an NPC or vice versa, stealth mode ends,
            and initiative is drawn (next page). Draw initiative even if
            the NPC is not obviously hostile – forcing PCs who act first
            to decide whether to attack or hold off. Also note that PCs
            can exchange initiatives with NPCs or each other on their
            turn (see Holding Off on the next page). Combat can also
            be initiated by an ambush (next page).</p>
        <h2>Social Mode</h2>
        <p>When you stop to interact socially with NPCs, or just stop
            to relieve stress (page 73) or chat among each other,
            stealth mode stops. During social mode, the GM estimates
            how many stretches pass and moves NPCs on the hidden
            stealth map accordingly. Social mode can also be used
            when you perform a task that takes more than a stretch
            to complete. When you start moving around on the map
            again, stealth mode starts anew.</p>

                    the Xeno herself.
                    The opposed roll is a tie, and they spot each other at the same time!

        <h1>Combat & Initiative</h1>
        <p><strong>WHEN THE ENEMY IS REVEALED</strong>, stealth mode is over,
            and combat starts. Combat is played out in rounds, each
            approximately 5–10 seconds long. At the start of each
            round, the first step is to decide who has the initiative – in
            what order the combatants will act during the round.</p>
        <h2>Drawing The Initiative</h2>
        <p>To determine the initiative, ten cards numbered 1 to 10 are
            used. Such initiative cards are included in the Hope’s Last
            Day Starter Set, but you can also use ordinary playing
            cards. Each player in the fight draws a random card at the
            beginning of each round, and the GM draws cards for NPCs.</p>
        <p>The number on the card determines the order in which
            you act in the round. Card #1 acts first, card #2 acts
            second, and so forth until everyone has acted. Your place
            in the initiative order is called your turn. Your “previous turn”
            or “your next turn” can occur in the current round or the
            previous/next round, depending on if you’ve had your turn
            in the current round yet.</p>
        <p>Place your initiative card by your character sheet so
            everyone can see the order in which each person acts.
            The GM puts their card (or cards) in front of them. When
            all participants have had their turn, the round is over, and a
            new round begins by drawing the initiative again.</p>
        <p>Xenomorphs have a Speed rating and get one turn – and
            initiative card – per point of Speed. Read more on page 208.</p>

        <div class="alien-info-box-tab">
            <div class="alien-info-box-tab-header">NPC Initiatives</div>
            <p>To make things simple, particularly in large fights,
                the GM can draw a single initiative card for a
                group of NPCs. All NPCs in that group act on the
                same turn in the round. The order among them is
                decided by the GM. When a PC holds off to swap
                initiative cards, they swap initiative with the whole
                NPC group.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="alien-info-box-top-border">
            <div class="alien-info-box-title">Too Many Draws?</div>
            <p>Combat in the ALIEN RPG is fast and deadly, and
                rarely lasts longer than 3–5 rounds. Drawing initiative every round gives a more dynamic flow of play,
                but should you find it cumbersome, you can draw
                initiative only in the first round of combat. Holding
                off and swapping initiative cards can still be done.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Surprise & Ambush</h2>
        <p>If combat starts with an attack that the GM deems to be
            surprising, the attacker automatically gets the #1 initiative
            card in the first round of combat. The other combatants
            draw their initiative from the cards that remain. With several
            attackers, they get the lowest (earliest) cards to distribute
            freely. At the start of the second round, everyone draws
            the initiative as usual.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Ambush:</h3> A special type of surprise attack is an ambush,
        which is an attack on an unaware opponent. Ambushes
        are usually the result of stealth mode (page 56). An
        ambush also gives the lowest (earliest) initiative card to the
        attacker(s), and gives +2 dice to the initial attack(s), and
        the target(s) cannot defend against it or dodge it.</p>
        <h2>Holding Off</h2>
        <p>At your turn in the round, you can choose to hold off. This
            means that you swap initiative cards – and therefore places
            in the turn order – with another PC or NPC (or NPC group)
            whose turn comes after yours. They cannot refuse the
            trade and must take their turn immediately. You cannot
            swap initiative cards with someone who has already had
            their turn.</p>
        <p class="alien-indent-paragraph"><strong>Note:</strong> All rules effects that are triggered “on your turn”
            (such as death rolls, see page 68) are moved in the turn
            order when initiative cards are swapped. Your turn doesn’t
            happen until you use it.</p>
        <p>
        <h3><span class="alien-warning-icon"></span>Interrupt Actions:</h3> Quick actions that occur out of
        turn (such as defending or dodging) are not affected by
        holding off – spent quick actions still count as spent, even
        if you get a new initiative number. Even if you have spent
        two quick actions as interrupt actions earlier in the round,
        and thus don’t get any action on your turn, you can still hold
        off and swap cards when your turn comes – this can be
        useful to give another PC an earlier spot in the turn order.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Xenomorphs</h3> (page 208) with a Speed of 2 or more
        have multiple turns in a single round, and therefore draw
        multiple initiative cards. When swapping cards with a
        Xenomorph, you decide which card you want, as long
        as it comes after your current turn in the initiative order.
        Xenomorphs themselves rarely hold off, but can if the
        adventure text or GM says so. </p>

        <p>
        <h3>Full Action:</h3> This is typically an attack but can be anything
        you could reasonably do in less than 10 seconds that
        requires your full focus. It typically requires a skill roll. See
        the adjacent list for examples. A full action can only be
        performed on your turn in the round.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Quick Action:</h3> These are faster and don’t necessarily
        demand a skill roll (though some do). Quick actions include
        movement. See the adjacent list for examples. Some quick
        actions can be performed out of turn, to interrupt the
        actions of opponents. On your turn, you can save your
        quick action for an interrupt action to use later in the round.
        If you perform two quick actions in the same round, you
        forfeit your full action.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Action Reset:</h3> All actions are reset at the start of a new
        combat round. Actions can never be saved from one round
        to the next.</p>
        <h2>Giving Orders</h2>
        <p>As a full action, you can bark orders to another character.
            They must be able to hear you, even if via a comm radio.
            Roll for COMMAND. For every <span class="alien-dice-success"></span> you roll, they get +1 die to
            one roll later in the same round, but only for carrying out
            the order you gave.</p>

                to keep your initiative face-up and vertical at the
                start of the round. Turn it horizontally when you
                perform a quick action. Flip the card over when you
                perform a full action or your second quick action.
                When the card is both rotated and flipped, you’re

        <h2>Foot Movement</h2>
        <p>To move during combat, you can spend a quick action to go
            from one zone to an adjacent zone, to move up to a door
            or hatch to peek through it (or take cover by it), or to move
            between Short and Adjacent range from a character (or
            item) inside your current zone.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Doors & Hatches:</h3> You can pass an unlocked door
        or hatch during movement without spending an action.
        Locking a door or hatch is typically a quick action. A locked
        door or hatch can be broken down. This requires a close
        combat attack (full action) with +2 dice. A typical metal
        door or hatch has armor level 2 and can take 10 points of
        damage before it gives in. Electronically locked doors or
        hatches can be opened with a <span class="alien-code">COMTECH</span> roll (full action).</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Blocking Movement:</h3> You can, as long as you’re not
        broken (page 68), block another character from moving
        past you. As a rule of thumb, you can block a cylindrical
        volume 2 meters wide and equally tall. To pass you, your
        opponent must either take you out or make a special close
        combat action (page 62). Blocking is not mandatory –
        you can allow friendly characters to pass you.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Crawlspaces:</h3> In a narrow crawlspace such as an air
        shaft, you cannot move past other characters in the same
        zone – not even friendlies.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Xenomorphs</h3> often prefer to move through air shafts
        and other crawlspaces, but can move through rooms and
        corridors just like human characters, including opening
        unlocked doors.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Dragging A Person:</h3> You can drag a broken or otherwise
        immobilized person with you when you move. The person
        needs to be at Adjacent range, and you need to make a
        <span class="alien-code">STAMINA</span> roll. If you fail, you remain in the zone.</p>
        <h2>Leaving Combat</h2>
        <p>You can attempt to leave a combat before it’s over by
            moving out of sight of your opponents. If you do, and it’s
            not obvious where you went (GM’s call), your opponents
            must roll for <span class="alien-code">OBSERVATION</span> (no action) to understand where
            you went. If it fails, combat is over, and stealth mode
            commences again (unless other PCs remain in combat). </p>

        <div class="alien-info-box-tab">
            <div class="alien-info-box-tab-header">Tokens & Miniatures</div>
            <p>If you are using official ALIEN RPG tokens or
                miniatures on a map that is to scale, mark Adjacent
                range by placing the tokens or miniature bases
                in contact. If there is no way to move into a zone
                without placing the tokens or miniatures in contact,
                the range between them is immediately Adjacent
                (not Short), without a further move action needed.</p>
            <p class="alien-indent-paragraph">You can move into a narrow area on the map
                (such as a crawlspace) even if your token or
                miniature base is wider than the space you’re in.
                However, if the tokens /miniatures of other characters make it impossible to place at least half of your
                token / base inside a zone (GM’s call), you cannot
                move into it. Broken characters don’t count.</p>
            <p class="alien-indent-paragraph">You can block movement in an area covered
                by the token or the base of the miniature. Several
                characters can be placed in base-to-base contact
                to block wider areas</p>

            <div class="alien-info-box-title">Hidden Movement In Combat</div>
            <p>In combat, movement is usually open for all to see.
                However, in some situations, the GM may choose
                to keep NPC movement hidden in combat, using a
                hidden GM map just like in stealth mode. All other
                normal movement rules for combat apply.</p>

                    and wounded but still alive — draws the &num;1 card.
                    Hayes decides to hold off and swaps his card with Nat, allowing her to go first. She spends both her
                    quick and her full action to move, running the two zones over to reach the medbay, just in time to
                    face the Xenomorph.

        <h1>Close Combat</h1>
        <p><strong>CLOSE COMBAT</strong> is any attack at Adjacent range, no matter
            what weapon is used (if any). This is a full action. Roll for
            <span class="alien-code">CLOSE COMBAT</span> to hit. Close combat weapons can give a
            modifier to your roll (see chapter 5).
        </p>
        <p>
        <h3>Hit:</h3> If the attack succeeds, it inflicts the weapon’s base
        damage on the target, plus 1 damage point for every <span class="alien-dice-success"></span> rolled
        beyond the first. Damage may be reduced by body armor
        (page 67). Unarmed attacks have a base damage of 1.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Weak Spot:</h3> Against an armored target, you can aim for
        a weak spot, getting –2 dice. On a hit, the armor level is
        reduced 1 step (after reduction for an armor piercing attack).</p>

        <h2>Defend</h2>
        <p>If you are attacked in close combat, you can choose to
            defend yourself against the attack, to avoid being hit.
            Defending is a quick action, and you roll for <span class="alien-code">CLOSE COMBAT</span>.
            You must state that you defend before the attacker rolls
            for their strike. Defending turns the attack into an opposed
            roll (page 44) – for each <span class="alien-dice-success"></span> you roll when defending, you
            eliminate one <span class="alien-dice-success"></span> rolled by the attacker.</p>

        <p>
        <h3><span class="alien-warning-icon"></span> Interruption:</h3> Defending is an interrupt action and
        occurs out of turn. It does require a quick action however
        – if you have no actions left in the round, you cannot defend.
        If you fear you will be attacked later in a round, it might be
        wise to save a quick action for a possible defense.</p>

        <h2>Special Attacks</h2>
        <p>In close combat, you may want to achieve something other
            than just harming your opponent. You must state that you
            are attempting a special attack before rolling dice, and
            you cannot use any bonus dice from a weapon. Special
            attacks can be defended against just like normal attacks.
            If the attack succeeds, you inflict no damage but instead
            achieve the desired result:</p>
        <ul class="alien-chevron-list">
            <li>Disarm: You wrestle an item from your opponent’s grasp. You can keep the item or throw it into an
                adjacent zone as part of the attack.</li>
            <li>Pass: You move past an enemy blocking your movement (page 61). If successful, place your token or
                miniature on the other side of the enemy.</li>
            <li>Shove: You push your opponent to Short range from you. This attack can be used to shove your target
                through a door or hatch.</li>
            <li>Grapple: You pin your enemy in a tight clinch. See Grappling below.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Grappling</h2>
        <p>If you grapple your opponent as a special attack in close
            combat, they cannot move or perform any actions except
            trying to break free. This is a full action and an opposed
            <span class="alien-code">CLOSE COMBAT</span> roll against you (Xenomorphs use <span
                class="alien-code">MOBILITY</span>
            instead). While you are grappling, the only action you can
            perform (until you choose to release your opponent) is a
            grapple attack. This works as a normal unarmed attack but
            cannot be defended against.
        </p>

        </div>

        <h2>Restrained & Unaware Opponents</h2>
        <p>If your close combat opponent is restrained or unaware of
            you (see Surprise & Ambush on page 59), they cannot
            defend themselves against the attack and you get +2 dice
            to the roll.</p>
        <h2>Firearms In Close Combat</h2>
        <p>Note that you can use a firearm even in close combat. You
            still use the CLOSE COMBAT skill (not RANGED COMBAT) to
            hit. As most firearms have a minimum range of Short (or
            more), you typically get –2 dice or more when using them
            in close combat. Your target can defend against the attack
            normally.</p>

                    Hayes tried to defend himself against the attack.
                    With Strength 3 and no skill level in <span class="alien-code">CLOSE COMBAT</span>, he only rolls
                    three base dices, but with stress level 3 he also get to add three stress dice.
                    He gets a single <span class="alien-dice-success"></span> and luckily, no <span
                        class="alien-dice-stress-failure"></span>.
                </p>
                <p class="alien-indent-paragraph">Knowing a single hit from the Xenomorph will likely end him, Hayes
                    decides to push the roll, increasing his stress level to 4 and adding another stress die to his
                    pool.
                    The re-roll produces another <span class="alien-dice-success"></span>, meaning Hayes just barely
                    manage to hold off the ferocious attack.
                </p>
                <p class="alien-indent-paragraph">However, the re-roll also produces a <span
                        class="alien-dice-stress-failure"></span>, triggering a stress response.
                    He rolls a D6 getting 6, adding his stress level of 4 and subtracting his Resolve of 5, meaning he's
                    really frantic, getting -2 on all skill rolls based on Strength.</p>

        </div>

        <h1>Ranged Combat</h1>
        <p><strong>WHEN YOU ATTACK SOMEONE</strong> at Short distance or more,
            roll for <span class="alien-code">RANGED COMBAT</span>. You need to have line of sight to
            your target (page 55). You also need a ranged weapon,
            even if just something to throw. The weapons tables in
            chapter 5 describe a variety of firearms and other ranged
            weapons. Most ranged weapons give a modifier to your
            roll. Firing a weapon is a full action.</p>

        <p>
        <h3>Hit:</h3> If the attack succeeds, it inflicts the weapon’s base
        damage on the target, plus 1 damage point for every
        rolled beyond the first (unless the extra
        are spent to
        conserve ammo, see below). Damage may be reduced by
        armor (page 67).</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Aiming:</h3> If you take your time to aim carefully before squeez-
        ing the trigger, you get +2 dice to your roll. Aiming is a quick
        action and can only be done at Short range or more. The aim
        must happen on your turn, immediately before the attack.
        This means you cannot do anything else in the same round.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Range:</h3> Weapons have a minimum and maximum range.
        Any attack closer than the minimum range gets –2 dice
        per range band below the minimum range. This does not
        apply to attacks against unaware or restrained targets.
        A weapon cannot be used beyond its maximum range –
        with the exception that you can fire a weapon with Short
        maximum range into an adjacent zone if you’re standing
        right next to a door or hatch to that zone.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Weak Spot:</h3> Against an armored target, you can aim for
        a weak spot, getting –2 dice. On a hit, the armor level is
        reduced 1 step (after reduction for an armor piercing attack).</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Target Size:</h3> Firing at a large target, such as a vehicle,
        gives +2 dice. Firing at a small object, such as a terminal
        screen, a hand-held item, or a Chestburster, gives −2 dice.</p>

        <h2>Dodging</h2>
        <p>If you are attacked in ranged combat, you can try to dodge
            the attack. This is a quick action, and you roll for <span class="alien-code">MOBILITY</span>.
            You can only dodge if you are aware of the attacker,
            and you must declare a dodge before the attacker rolls.
            Dodging turns the attack into an opposed roll (page 44)
            – for each
            you roll when dodging, you eliminate one
            rolled by the attacker.</p>
        <p>
        <h3><span class="alien-warning-icon"></span> Interruption:</h3> Dodging is an interrupt action and
        occurs out of turn. It does require a quick action however
        – if you have no actions left in the round, you cannot dodge.
        If you fear you will be attacked later in a round, it might be
        wise to save a quick action for a possible dodge.</p>

        <h2>Cover</h2>
        <p>When bullets start flying, you’ll do well to seek cover. It’s also
            very effective against explosions (page 76). You can only take
            cover in a cluttered zone, never in an open zone – except by a
            door or hatch, which gives you cover against enemies in the
            adjacent zone. There are two types of cover – partial and full.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Partial Cover:</h3> Taking partial cover is a quick action. You ex-
        pose enough of yourself to be able to see, and shoot at, your
        enemy. When in partial cover, any ranged attack against you
        gets –2 dice. You can dodge (above) when in partial cover.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Full Cover:</h3> Completely hiding yourself from view is a full
        action. Full cover breaks line of sight. Ranged attacks are
        still possible but get –3 dice and the attacks must penetrate
        the barrier (page 68). You cannot dodge when in full cover.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Direction Of Cover:</h3> For the sake of simplicity, you don’t
        need to consider the direction of your cover, it’s assumed
        to protect you from all sides. The GM may overrule this
        however, if the situation warrants it.</p>
        <h2>Friendly Fire</h2>
        <p>If you fire at a target Adjacent to another character and
            miss, you risk hitting the unintended target instead. Roll
            for an attack with two base dice, inflicting base damage if
            one <span class="alien-dice-success"></span>
            is rolled and 1 additional damage on two <span class="alien-dice-success"></span>. If there
            are several Adjacent targets, randomize which one is hit.</p>

        <div class="alien-info-box-top-border">
            <div class="alien-info-box-title">The Supply Dail</div>
            <p>The supply dial included in the Hope’s Last Day
                Starter Set can be used to track ammo. Even when
                using the dial, you still need to track reloads on the
                character sheet. In Ammo column, there is space
                to mark both maximum ammo and current ammo
                for the weapon.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Ammunition</h2>
        <p>Ranged weapons require ammunition. You don’t need to
            count individual bullets. Instead, the ammo capacity of each
            weapon in chapter 5 works as a supply rating (page 29).
            After each attack, make a supply roll for your weapon.
            When the ammo supply runs out, you need to reload.</p>

        <p>
        <h3>Conserving Ammo:</h3> If you roll more than one
        <span class="alien-dice-success"></span> for an
        attack, you can spend one <span class="alien-dice-success"></span>
        to conserve ammo instead
        of increasing the damage, meaning no supply roll needs to
        be made after the attack. You cannot use this rule to fire a
        weapon with zero ammo left.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Reload:</h3> Reloading a firearm is a quick action, unless
        stated otherwise. You need to track your available reloads
        on your character sheet.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Single-Shot:</h3> Weapons designated as single-shot must
        be reloaded after each shot – no supply roll is made. You
        cannot use extra <span class="alien-dice-success"></span>
        to conserve ammo for these.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>NPCs:</h3> For NPCs, the GM typically doesn’t make ammo
        supply rolls. Instead, their ammo capacity is reduced by
        one step after each attack, unless they spend an extra <span class="alien-dice-success"></span>
        to conserve ammo. The GM can overrule this at any time
        it is dramatically appropriate.</p>
        <h2>Full Auto</h2>
        <p>Some weapons in chapter 5 can fire bursts of bullets. When
            you fire a burst and hit without pushing the roll, you can
            immediately make another attack roll, at the same target or
            another, as part of the same action. If you hit again (without
            pushing), you may roll a third time. As soon as you miss, or
            push a roll, the attack is over. Each attack roll except the
            first gives you stress level +1. You cannot make more than
            three attack rolls in a single action.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Ammo:</h3> When firing a burst, you must make an ammo
        supply roll after each attack roll. You cannot use extra <span class="alien-dice-success"></span>
        rolled in the attack roll to conserve ammo.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Aiming:</h3> If you aim carefully (page 64), the bonus will
        only apply to the first attack roll.</p>

            <div class="alien-example-box-content">
                <p>Nat, at Short range from the Xenomorph, raises her
                    Rexim RXF-M5 EVA Pistol at the Xenomorph, using her
                    quick action to aim carefully and her full action to fire.
                    With no skill level in <span class="alien-code">RANGED COMBAT</span>, she needs all the
                    bonuses she can get. She rolls six base dice (three for her Agility 3, +1 for her Rexim, and +2 for
                    aiming) and
                    two stress dice (her current stress level is 2), getting
                    two <span class="alien-dice-success"></span>, Nat could use the extra <span
                        class="alien-dice-success"></span> to conserve ammo
                    but decides to maximize the damage. The Rexim has a base damage rating of 1, meaning the shot hits
                    for 2
                    points of damage.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h1>Damage</h1>
        <p><strong>IN COMBAT</strong>, you run the risk of being injured. Everything
            from exhaustion to bleeding cuts and broken bones is
            summarized as damage. How much damage you can take
            before being broken is determined by your Health score.
            Your starting Health score is equal to the average of your
            Strength and Agility scores, rounded up. The Hardened
            talent can increase your maximum Health.</p>
        <h2>Armor</h2>
        <p>To protect yourself from harm, you can wear body armor
            (chapter 5). Xenomorphs often have natural body armor,
            and vehicles can also provide protection. The effectiveness
            of armor is represented by its armor level. You can only
            wear one suit of armor at a time.</p>
        <p class="alien-indent-paragraph"><strong>When you take damage from an external attack, the
                damage caused is reduced by the armor level.</strong></p>
        <p>
        <h3>Armor Piercing:</h3> Against attacks designated as armor
        piercing, the armor level counts as 1 step lower than its
        normal value (to a minimum of zero).</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Weak Spots:</h3> Attacks in both close and ranged combat
        can be aimed at weak spots in the armor. This gives the
        attack a –2 modifier, but on a hit, the armor level is reduced
        1 step (in addition to any reduction for an armor piercing
        attack).</p>

        <div class="alien-info-box-top-border">
            <div class="alien-info-box-title">No Weapons Of Any Kind</div>
            <p>You want to be careful where you point that thing
                in space. Firefights onboard spacecraft, space
                stations, and within pressure domes can be
                disastrous – a stray bullet can rupture the hull and
                vent an entire living sector into space (page 75).
                People have been blown out into space through
                the tiniest of tears in the hull – a gruesome way to
                go, for sure.</p>
            <p class="alien-indent-paragraph">Because of this, weapons are limited on
                spacecraft. Most military smart guns won’t fire
                when turned on a target along the outer hull of
                a safe-sensor equipped ship. Civilian weapons
                aren’t quite so clever. Your best bet is to keep ‘em
                holstered until you’ve exhausted all other options.
                Then hold on to something tight and make for an
                airlock.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Barriers</h2>
        <p>Barriers such as spaceship bulkheads also have armor
            levels – see the adjacent table for examples. When a
            ranged attack hits a barrier, the damage is reduced by the
            armor level. If the damage is reduced to zero, the attack
            does not breach the barrier.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Breach Limit:</h3> For barriers (and vehicles, see page 79),
        if the armor level is higher than the base damage rating
        of the weapon (not just equal), after any modifiers for
        ammunition and weak spots, the attack cannot breach the
        armor, no matter how many <span class="alien-dice-success"></span>
        are rolled.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Cover:</h3> Note that partial cover (page 66) does not
        provide an armor level – only full cover will do that. If you
        are in full cover behind a barrier and wear body armor, first
        apply the effect of the cover, then the armor.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Collateral Damage:</h3> In some zones, such as next to an
        outer bulkhead of a spaceship or a nuclear reactor, a stray
        bullet can trigger catastrophic effects. In such locations,
        the GM rolls one stress die each time a ranged attack
        that could potentially breach the relevant barrier (i.e. base
        damage ≥ modified armor level) misses its target. On a
        <span class="alien-dice-stress-failure"></span>,
        the barrier is breached.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>Broken</h2>
        <p>If you drop to zero Health, you are broken – in effect, taken
            out of the action. Immediately roll for a critical injury (page
            70). If you’re not dead, you can make a single move
            action per round and mumble through the pain, but not
            perform any other actions. You can’t go below zero Health,
            but any further damage gives you another critical injury.
            While broken, you cannot gain more stress and never make
            panic rolls. There are three ways to get back up after being
            broken, assuming you’re not dead:</p>
        <ul class="alien-chevron-list">
            <li>First Aid: Someone at Adjacent range can administer
                first aid with a <span class="alien-code">AID roll</span> (full action, modified
                for medical gear). On a success, you are no longer
                broken and recover 1 point of Health per
                rolled.
                If you suffer from a lethal critical injury, you are also
                stabilized (below).</li>
            <li>Rally: Another character in the same zone can try
                to rally you with a <span class="alien-code">COMMAND</span> roll (quick action). On a
                success, you are no longer broken and recover 1 point
                of Health per
                rolled. Rallying has no effect on critical
                injuries.</li>
            <li>On Your Own: If you’re broken (but not dead) and no
                one gives you first aid, you automatically get back up
                after one stretch of time and recover 1 point of Health.
                This has no effect on critical injuries.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        <h3>Recovery:</h3> As long as you are not fatigued (page 75),
        you automatically recover 1 point of Health per stretch of
        time spent resting in a safe area (even if suffering from a
        critical injury). First aid and rallying can only recover Health
        when you are broken.</p>

        <h2>Critical Injuries</h2>
        <p>As long as you still have Health left, damage points
            represent fatigue, bruises or smaller cuts – painful, to be
            sure, but possible to overcome. Critical injuries represent
            a much more dangerous form of injury. These can maim
            or kill you. When knocked down to zero Health, roll a D66
            on the table on page 70. If you roll a critical injury you
            already have (result #14 and above), re-roll.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Death:</h3> If you suffer a critical injury listed as lethal, you
        must make a death roll after the listed time limit has passed.
        If the time limit is round, roll on your every turn, right after
        you act. A death roll is a roll for <span class="alien-code">STAMINA</span> (not an action),
        but you cannot push it, and you are not allowed to roll any
        stress dice. If you fail a death roll, you die. If you succeed,
        you linger on, but you must make another death roll when
        the time limit has passed again.</p>

                An NPC can rally or give first aid to a PC and vice
                versa. However, dice are usually not rolled when an
                NPC aids another NPC – instead, the GM decides
                what happens. The GM can also decide that a

                <p>The Xenomorph, ignoring Nat, strikes Hayes again. This
                    time, he fails to defend himself and goes to zero Health,
                    broken. He rolls for a critical injury and gets 62 — a
                    massive hemorrhage!
                </p>
                <p class="alien-indent-paragraph">Nat tries to give Hayes first aid to stop the bleeding
                    with a <span class="alien-code">MEDICAL AID</span> roll but fails. Desperate, she
                    then uses her quick action for a <span class="alien-code">COMMAND</span> roll to rally
                    Hayes. This succeeds, and Hayes joins the fight again.
                </p>
                <p class="alien-indent-paragraph">On his next turn, Hayes fights valiantly against the
                    beast, shouting at Nat to get out to save herself. Then
                    make a death roll. Sadly, the <span class="alien-code">STAMINA</span> roll fails, and Nat
                    can only watch in horror as Hayes collapses on the floor, dead.

        <p>
        <h3>First Aid:</h3> To save your life when you have suffered a lethal
        critical injury, someone must give you first aid to stabilize
        you before you fail a death roll. This is a full action and
        requires a <span class="alien-code">MEDICAL AID</span> roll, modified for medical gear. If
        you are no longer broken, you can try to administer first
        aid on yourself, but with −2 dice.</p>
        <ul class="alien-chevron-list">
            <li>If the roll succeeds, you are stabilized and can stop
                making death rolls. If you were broken, you also recover
                1 point of Health per <span class="alien-dice-success"></span>
                rolled. The other effects of your
                critical injury remain until healed.</li>
            <li>If the roll fails, your condition worsens – the time limit is
                decreased one step, for example from shift to stretch,
                or stretch to round. If the time limit was already round,
                you perish.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        <h3>On Your Own:</h3> If you succeed at three death rolls on your
        own, you survive without help and can stop rolling.
        Instant Kill: Note that there are three critical injuries
        (results #64–66) that kill you outright. If you roll any of
        these, you’re dead. No death rolls, no chance of surviving –
        you’re done for. Some Xenomorph signature attacks (page
        208) can also be instantly fatal. Finally, if the damage from
        a single instance equals or exceeds double your maximum
        Health, you are killed outright.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Healing:</h3> Each critical injury has a specific effect that you
        suffer during the healing time indicated, which is measured
        in days unless stated otherwise. Several critical injuries can
        heal simultaneously. Each day during which someone with
        the Nurse talent tends to you while healing counts double.
        Note that you can recover all your lost Health points but
        still suffer the effects of a critical injury.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Surgery:</h3> Some critical injuries require surgery before
        they start to heal – this takes a shift of time and requires
        a <span class="alien-code">MEDICAL AID</span> roll (with bonuses for talents and medical
        gear).</p>

        <h2>Stun Damage</h2>
        <p>Some weapons inflict stun damage instead of normal
            damage. Attacks from such weapons don’t reduce your
            Health – instead, when hit you need to make a <span class="alien-code">STAMINA</span> roll
            (no action) with a negative modifier equal to the damage
            inflicted. If you fail, you can’t perform any action on your
            next turn, nor any quick actions until then.
            On your next turn, roll <span class="alien-code">STAMINA</span> again, this time unmod-
            ified. If you fail again, you’re stunned until your next turn
            after that, and so on until you make a successful <span class="alien-code">STAMINA</span>
            roll. The <span class="alien-code">STAMINA</span> rolls can be pushed normally, and armor
            works normally against stun damage.</p>

        <h1>Panic Rolls</h1>

        <p><strong>BEING IN THE COLD DARKNESS</strong> of space will test your
            nerves even under normal circumstances. Add horrifying
            Xenomorphs, and you really need to keep your nerves in
            check to avoid spiraling into a wild panic.</p>
        <h2>Stress Level</h2>
        <p>The mounting tension in your character is measured by
            your stress level. It usually starts at zero and increases
            during the course of the game. Your stress can increase
            in many ways, such as:</p>

        <ul class="alien-chevron-list">
            <li>You push a skill roll (page 43).</li>
            <li>You or a nearby PC suffers a certain stress or panic response (next page).</li>
            <li>A nearby NPC panics (as determined by the GM).</li>
            <li>You fire a second or third burst of full auto fire (page 67).</li>
            <li>You become fatigued (page 75).</li>
            <li>A member of your own crew attacks you.</li>
            <li>A person nearby is revealed to be an android.</li>
            <li>Any unnerving encounter as determined by the adventure or the GM.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Panic Roll</h2>
        <p>As long as you keep your stress in check, you can use it to
            your advantage. But if the tension grows too strong it can
            explode, sending you into a wild panic. You need to make
            a panic roll when any of the following happens:</p>
        <ul class="alien-chevron-list">
            <li>You witness another PC become broken.</li>
            <li>You see a horrifying Xenomorph for the first time.</li>
            <li>A terrifying Xenomorph comes within Adjacent range (even if you have seen it before).</li>
            <li>You witness another PC suffer from a certain panic response.</li>
            <li>A truly horrifying event occurs, as determined by the adventure or the GM.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        <h3>Resolution:</h3> Roll a D6, add your current stress level,
        subtract your Resolve rating, and compare the result to
        the table on the next page.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>More Panic:</h3> If you are suffering from a panic response
        and are forced to make another panic roll, you suffer both
        responses if possible. In cases where two responses cannot
        be combined, the higher response takes precedence. If you
        already have a panic response (or stress response of the
        same name) and roll the same again, use the next higher
        response on the table.</p>
        <h2>Stopping Panic</h2>
        <p>Some panic responses are immediate or last until your next
            turn. If this is not the case, the effect remains until one of
            the following happens:</p>
        <ul class="alien-chevron-list">
            <li>Another character within speaking range (including comms) makes a
                <span class="alien-code">COMMAND</span> roll. This is a full action in
                combat.
            </li>
            <li>You are broken.</li>
            <li>One stretch passes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Relieving Stress</h2>
        <p>For every stretch of time (5–10 minutes) spent resting
            in a safe area, your stress level is reduced by 1 point. In
            addition, one stress response (page 44) of your choice
            is removed for each stress level reduced. You can’t make
            skill rolls when resting, and if your rest is interrupted, it
            doesn’t count. A panic roll can also decrease stress, as
            can certain drugs (page 98).</p>

        <h2>Mental Trauma</h2>
        <p>If you have rolled a result of 9 or higher on a panic roll
            during a game session, make an Empathy roll after the
            session. Roll for the attribute only, not using any skill.
            The roll cannot be pushed. If the roll fails, you develop a
            mental trauma of some kind. Roll a D66 and consult the
            table below. Mental trauma can only be healed during shore
            leave in campaign play (page 257).</p>

        <h1>Other Hazards</h1>
        <p><strong>THE WORLD OF ALIEN</strong> is unforgiving, and there are many
            ways for your character to suffer and die.</p>
        <h2>Fatigue</h2>
        <p>If you don’t get enough air, water, food, or sleep, or if you
            are exposed to extreme cold or heat without adequate
            protection, you must make <span class="alien-code">SURVIVAL</span> rolls at regular
            intervals. As soon as you fail such a roll, you become
            fatigued. Mark this on your character sheet. Being fatigued
            has several effects:</p>
        <ul class="alien-chevron-list">
            <li>You can no longer recover Health.</li>
            <li>You must continue to make <span class="alien-code">SURVIVAL</span> rolls at the same
                intervals. For each failed roll, you suffer 1 point of damage
                and gain +1 stress level.</li>
            <li>If broken by damage from fatigue, don’t roll for a critical
                injury. Instead, make death rolls at the same interval as
                the <span class="alien-code">SURVIVAL</span> rolls. First aid has no effect against these
                rolls – only removing the source of the fatigue will stop
                the death rolls.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        <h3>Suffocation:</h3> If your supply of air runs out (page 28), or
        if under water, you must make a <span class="alien-code">SURVIVAL</span> roll every round
        (in combat, the roll does not count as an action).</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Hunger & Thirst:</h3> As a rule of thumb, you need to eat
        and drink something every day. After a full 24 hours
        without food and water, you must make <span class="alien-code">SURVIVAL</span> rolls
        once per shift.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Sleep Deprivation:</h3> You must sleep at least one shift
        per day. After a full 24 hours without sleep, you must
        make <span class="alien-code">SURVIVAL</span> rolls once per shift. If you are broken by
        a <span class="alien-code">SURVIVAL</span> roll caused by sleep deprivation, don’t make
        death rolls – instead, you pass out and sleep for a full shift,
        impossible to wake. Certain drugs (page 98) can help
        against sleep deprivation.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Heat & Cold:</h3> How often you need to make <span class="alien-code">SURVIVAL</span> rolls
        due to extreme temperatures depends on the situation,
        and is decided by the adventure text or the GM. It can be
        once per day, shift, stretch, or even round (in combat, the
        roll does not count as an action).</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Hypersleep:</h3> Spending any length of time in hypersleep
        will make you fatigued. Hypersleep fatigue is remedied
        after one shift awake, assuming you eat a sturdy meal.
        The effect can also be counteracted by the Hydr8tion drug
        (page 98).</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Recovery:</h3> As soon as the hazardous situation is remedied,
        you are no longer fatigued and stop making <span class="alien-code">SURVIVAL</span> rolls.
        If broken, you can then be stabilized.
        Androids are completely immune to all forms of fatigue.</p>
        <h2>Vacuum</h2>
        <p>Space is a cold and unforgiving place. If your ship suffers
            explosive decompression (below) or if you are thrown out
            of an airlock, your life is in extreme danger. The absence of
            pressure creates gas bubbles in your blood, causing your
            whole body to swell up. This results in crippling pain, all while
            the raw UV radiation from the nearest star sears your skin.</p>
        <p class="alien-indent-paragraph">In a vacuum, you suffer +1 stress level each round and
            you must make a <span class="alien-code">SURVIVAL</span> roll before you can take action.
            The roll itself is not an action. The first roll is unmodified,
            but you get −1 dice on the second roll, –2 on the third roll,
            and so on. A failed roll means you drop directly to zero
            Health and become broken. Don’t roll for a critical injury –
            instead, make a death roll every round. Nothing can stop
            these death rolls except escaping the vacuum.</p>

        <h2>Explosive Decompression</h2>
        <p>Firing guns inside a spacecraft is very dangerous. If a shot
            misses its target in a zone next to an outer bulkhead that
            can potentially be breached by the shot (page 79), the
            GM rolls one stress die. On a
            <span class="alien-dice-stress-failure"></span>, the barrier is breached.
            If a character intentionally tries to shoot a hole in the hull,
            make a normal ranged attack with +2 dice.
        </p>
        <p class="alien-indent-paragraph">A hull breach is bad news for everyone. The air will
            vent out into space at a rate of one stretch per affected
            zone, and the intense draft will require everyone to make
            a <span class="alien-code">SURVIVAL</span> roll on their turn to perform any action (this roll
            itself is not an action).</p>
        <p class="alien-indent-paragraph">Most ships will automatically seal off a breached zone.
            Once the air is gone, anyone still in the vented zone will
            suffer the effects of vacuum.</p>
        <h2>Falling</h2>
        <p>Falling on a hard surface in gravity automatically inflicts
            an amount of damage to you equal to the height of the fall
            (in meters) divided by 2, rounding all fractions down. In a
            controlled jump, roll <span class="alien-code">MOBILITY</span> – each
            <span class="alien-dice-success"></span> rolled reduces the
            damage done by 1. Body armor does not protect you.

        <h2>Zero Gravity</h2>
        <p>Most ships and stations have artificial gravity generators,
            but these can fail. You can also find yourself spacewalking
            outside your ship. In a zone without gravity, all rolls for <span class="alien-code">CLOSE
                COMBAT</span>, <span class="alien-code">HEAVY MACHINERY</span>, <span class="alien-code">MOBILITY</span>
            and <span class="alien-code">RANGED COMBAT</span>
            get –2 dice. In addition, every move requires a successful
            <span class="alien-code">MOBILITY</span> roll (without the penalty), with failure meaning you
            spin in place and suffer +1 stress level. The Zero-G Training
            talent removes all of the above effects.
        </p>
        <p class="alien-indent-paragraph">On the flip side, zero gravity allows you to move in any
            direction, floating through open air (or space). And you
            never risk falling damage.</p>
        <h2>Explosions</h2>
        <p>Some weapons in chapter 5 have an explosive effect. You
            fire these as a normal ranged attack, but if you hit your
            target, all other characters in the same zone (PC and NPCs
            alike) suffer the same damage. Each target can dodge
            the attack separately. If your attack misses, the shot is
            assumed to have gone astray and hurts no one.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Cover:</h3> For the primary target, cover page 66) has the
        same effect as in any ranged attack. Secondary targets in
        partial cover count as if they were in full cover (i.e. they get
        protection from the full armor level of the barrier).</p>

        <p>
        <h3>Contained spaces:</h3> If you fire an explosive weapon into
        a zone with only blocked borders (via a hatch or door from
        an adjacent zone, or inside the zone behind cover), you get
        +2 dice to the attack.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Placed Explosives:</h3> Detonations caused by anything
        that’s not a ranged attack have a blast power and a base
        damage. The base damage is equal to one third of the blast
        power (round up to the nearest whole number). When the
        explosion occurs, roll for an attack with a number of base
        dice equal to the blast power. If the attack hits, every PC
        and NPC in the zone suffers the base damage plus 1 point of
        damage for each <span class="alien-dice-success"></span>
        rolled beyond the first. This is not a skill
        roll and cannot be pushed. All targets behind partial or full
        cover get protection from the full armor level of the barrier).</p>

        <h2>Fire</h2>
        <p>A fire typically covers one zone and is measured by its
            intensity. A typical fire has intensity 6–9. When entering
            a burning zone, or starting a round in one, roll a number
            of base dice equal to the intensity. For every <span class="alien-dice-success"></span>
            rolled,
            you suffer 1 point of damage. Body armor has its normal
            effect. If you are broken by fire damage, don’t roll for a
            critical injury – instead, make a death roll every round until
            you’re out of the fire.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Catching Fire:</h3> If you take damage from a fire attack,
        you catch fire and continue to burn, suffering another fire
        attack at the start of each new round even if you leave the
        burning zone. As soon as a fire attack outside the burning
        zone inflicts no damage, you’re no longer on fire. You, or a
        friend at Adjacent range, can stop you from burning with a
        successful <span class="alien-code">MOBILITY</span> roll (full action).</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Fire Spreading:</h3> For a typical fire, roll a D6 at the start
        of each round. On 1–2, the fire goes out and the zone is no
        longer considered burning. On a 5–6, the fire spreads to a
        random adjacent zone, assuming the zone border is open
        and there is something in the adjacent zone that can burn.
        Specialized gear can be used to extinguish fires.</p>

        <h2>Disease</h2>
        <p>When exposed to a dangerous contagion or infection,
            you need to roll for <span class="alien-code">STAMINA</span> to avoid falling sick. This is a
            passive roll, and cannot be pushed. The GM may even roll
            for you in secret.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Virulence:</h3> Contagions have a virulence rating, which is
        a negative modifier to your <span class="alien-code">STAMINA</span> roll. If the virulence is
        not listed, it is zero.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Effects:</h3> Diseases can have a wide range of effects.
        A common effect is to make you fatigued (page 75), triggering further <span class="alien-code">STAMINA</span>
        rolls (instead of <span class="alien-code">SURVIVAL</span>)
        modified for virulence at regular intervals (typically once
        per shift), with the normal effects of fatigue if you fail. Once
        you succeed, your immune system has beaten the disease,
        and you can start to recover.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Medical Aid:</h3> If someone cares for you while you are
        sick, they can roll for <span class="alien-code">MEDICAL AID</span> to fight off the disease,
        replacing your <span class="alien-code">STAMINA</span> rolls. Medical gear can give
        bonuses to this.</p>

        <h2>Radiation</h2>
        <p>The world of ALIEN contains many places where you
            will be exposed to hard radiation – on a spacewalk near
            a dying star, for example, or when you try to repair your
            ship’s leaking reactor core.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Radiation Level:</h3> When you are exposed to radiation,
        you gain radiation points, or rads, that accumulate in your
        body. Mark your rads on your character sheet. The area’s
        radiation level determines how often you get rads.</p>

        <ul class="alien-chevron-list">
            <li>WEAK RADIATION: 1 rad per shift</li>
            <li>STRONG RADIATION: 1 rad per stretch</li>
            <li>EXTREME RADIATION: 1 rad per round</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        <h3>Effects:</h3> Every time you gain a radiation point, you must
        roll a number of dice equal to your total current number of
        accumulated rads. For every <span class="alien-dice-success"></span>
        rolled, you suffer 1 point of
        damage. If you are broken by radiation damage, don’t roll
        for a critical injury – instead, make death rolls at the same
        intervals as above until you’re out of the hotspot.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Recovery:</h3> As long as you remain in a hotspot, you cannot
        recover Health in any way. After you leave the irradiated
        area, you heal one rad per shift.</p>
        <h2>Synthetics</h2>
        <p>Synthetic individuals are increasingly common in the Core
            Systems, and appear on the Frontier as well. Some are
            open about their artificial nature, others pose as humans.
            In combat, androids act like humans, and they make skill
            rolls normally. But there are several differences:</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Attributes:</h3> Synthetics generally have higher attribute
        score than humans.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Skills & Stress:</h3> Androids can’t push skill rolls. They don’t
        suffer stress, don’t have a stress level, and they never make
        panic rolls.</p>

        <p>
        <h3>Damage:</h3> If a synthetic goes to zero Health, don’t roll for
        a normal critical injury. Instead, roll for critical systems
        damage on the table above. Until the android suffers a
        system shutdown (result #6), it can continue to operate,
        only suffering the effects of the critical damage. This makes
        androids very hard to stop.</p>
        <p class="alien-indent-paragraph">If an android at zero Health suffers further damage, roll
            again on the critical system damage. If you roll a damage
            that the android already has, shift it up one step on the
            table (from a #4 to a #5, for example).</p>

        <h3>Fatigue:</h3> Synthetics don’t need air, food, water, or sleep,
        and thus never suffer the effects of fatigue (page 75).
        They are immune to vacuum, cold, and disease. Androids
        are typically unaffected by alien pathogens.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Repairs:</h3> Androids don’t heal. Instead, a shift of work and a
        COMTECH roll is required to repair all lost Health points and
        all critical system damage, as long as the android hasn’t
        suffered a system shutdown. They can repair themselves.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>System Shutdown:</h3> An android that suffers a system
        shutdown is damaged beyond repair, but can be reactivated
        only to communicate with. This requires a power source, a
        stretch of work, and a COMTECH roll. Make a power supply
        roll after each stretch of communication.</p>

            <p>It is illegal to program an android for violence
                against humans. While modern synthetics are
                governed by behavioral inhibitors that prevent
                them from injuring others, earlier models are not so
                equipped and are therefore dangerous. Expensive
                bypass packages are available on the black market
                for those who want to circumvent these laws.</p>

            Fighting Xenomorph beings is something different entirely
            and far more deadly than facing humans or even androids.
            Very few have lived to tell the tale.</p>

            <li><strong>HULL:</strong> How much damage the vehicle can take before becoming wrecked.</li>
            <li><strong>ARMOR:</strong> The armor level of the vehicle.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Vehicles In Combat</h2>
        <p>Driving under normal circumstances requires no dice rolls,
            but more advanced maneuvers require <span class="alien-code">PILOTING</span> rolls.
            Entering or mounting a vehicle is a quick action. Starting a
            motorized vehicle is also a quick action.</p>

        <p>
        <h3>Movement:</h3> Driving a vehicle is a quick action, and it will
        move you a number of zones up to the Speed rating of your
        ride. Note that you can drive twice in the same round if you
        spend both of your actions on it.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Vehicle Armaments:</h3> Some vehicles are fitted with
        mounted heavy weapons, fired by the crew (and in some
        cases, the driver). You’ll find a list of vehicle weapons on
        page 313.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Ramming:</h3> Most vehicles can be used as weapons – i.e. to
        simply ram your enemy. It counts as a close combat attack,
        but roll for <span class="alien-code">PILOTING</span> instead of <span class="alien-code">CLOSE COMBAT</span>.
        Add the
        vehicle’s Maneuverability rating. The base damage rating
        of the attack equals your vehicle’s Hull rating divided by 2,
        rounding up.</p>

        <h2>Damage To Vehicles</h2>
        <p>When a vehicle has suffered damage equal to or in excess
            of its Hull rating, it is wrecked. This means that the vehicle
            becomes inoperable and everyone inside takes 3 points of
            damage, mitigated by a <span class="alien-code">MOBILITY</span> roll (no action) – each
            <span class="alien-dice-success"></span> reduces the damage by one point.
        </p>

        <p>
        <h3>Armor Level:</h3> Most vehicles have an armor level, which
        reduces the amount of incoming damage.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Breach Limit:</h3> For vehicles (and barriers, see page 68),
        if the armor level is higher than the base damage rating
        of the weapon (not just equal), after any modifiers for
        ammunition and weak spots, the attack cannot breach the
        armor, no matter how many <span class="alien-dice-success"></span>
        are rolled.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Component Damage:</h3> If a vehicle takes damage equal
        to or more than half its Hull rating (rounding up) in a single
        hit, it suffers component damage. Roll a D6 and consult
        the adjacent table.</p>

                                losing one zone of altitude per round.</p>

                                in a ball of flame. All people inside it are
                                immediately exposed to intensity 9 fire,
                                and the vehicle is destroyed beyond repair.</p>
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
        </div>

        <p>
        <h3>Exposed Passengers:</h3> Passengers in an open vehicle,
        or sitting on top of a vehicle, can be targeted separately. A
        partially exposed character is considered to be in partial
        cover (page 66) but not shielded by the armor level of
        the vehicle.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Ramming Vehicles:</h3> You can use your vehicle to ram
        another vehicle. Roll the attack like you would if you were
        ramming a person (above), but both vehicles suffer the
        base damage. Extra damage due to additional <span class="alien-dice-success"></span>
        is inflicted
        on the target only.</p>

        <h2>Aerial Vehicles</h2>
        <p>Aerial vehicles are handled in much the same way as
            ground vehicles, with some exceptions.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Altitude:</h3> At all times you must keep track of the vehicle’s
        altitude, measured in zones. When moving, you distribute
        the zones moved on vertical and horizontal movement. On
        the ground, the Speed of an aerial vehicle is typically 1.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Crashes:</h3> If an aerial vehicle is wrecked, it crashes violently
        to the ground. All people inside suffer damage equal to the
        altitude (in zones) multiplied by 2. You can brace yourself
        for the hit by rolling <span class="alien-code">MOBILITY</span> (not an action) – each
        <span class="alien-dice-success"></span> rolled reduces the damage by 1.</p>
        <h2>Repairs</h2>
        <p>Repairing vehicle damage requires one or several <span class="alien-code">HEAVY
                MACHINERY</span> rolls. One roll can be made per shift. Only
            one person can roll to repair the hull, but others can help.
            Each <span class="alien-dice-success"></span>
            removes 1 point of damage. If the vehicle was
            wrecked, it is no longer considered wrecked once it has
            regained at least 1 point of Hull.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Component Damage:</h3> If the engine or a mounted
        weapon has been disabled, repairing it typically requires
        a <span class="alien-code">HEAVY MACHINERY</span> roll, in addition to any roll for repairing
        Hull damage. The work takes one shift.</p>
